<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Towards the close of the seventies I began to collect
Welsh folklore. I did so partly because others had set the example
elsewhere, and partly in order to see whether Wales could boast of any
story-tellers of the kind that delight the readers of Campbell&rsquo;s
<i>Popular Tales of the West Highlands</i>. I soon found what I was not
wholly unprepared for, that as a rule I could not get a single story of
any length from the mouths of any of my fellow countrymen, but a
considerable number of bits of stories. In some instances these were so
scrappy that it took me years to discover how to fit them into their
proper context; but, speaking generally, I may say, that, as the
materials, such as they were, accumulated, my initial difficulties
disappeared. I was, however, always a little afraid of refreshing my
memory with the legends of other lands lest I should read into those of
my own, ideas possibly foreign to them. While one is busy collecting,
it is safest probably not to be too much engaged in comparison: when
the work of collecting is done that of comparing may begin. But after
all I have not attempted to proceed very far in that direction, only
just far enough to find elucidation here and there for the meaning of
items of folklore brought under my notice. To have gone further would
have involved me in excursions hopelessly beyond the limits of my
undertaking, for comparative folklore has lately assumed <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd25e219" href="#xd25e219" name=
"xd25e219">viii</a>]</span>such dimensions, that it seems best to leave
it to those who make it their special study.</p>
<p>It is a cause of genuine regret to me that I did not commence my
inquiries earlier, when I had more opportunities of pursuing them,
especially when I was a village schoolmaster in Anglesey and could have
done the folklore of that island thoroughly; but my education, such as
it was, had been of a nature to discourage all interest in anything
that savoured of heathen lore and superstition. Nor is that all, for
the schoolmasters of my early days took very little trouble to teach
their pupils to keep their eyes open or take notice of what they heard
around them; so I grew up without having acquired the habit of
observing anything, except the Sabbath. It is to be hoped that the
younger generation of schoolmasters trained under more auspicious
circumstances, when the baleful influence of Robert Lowe has given way
to a more enlightened system of public instruction, will do better, and
succeed in fostering in their pupils habits of observation. At all
events there is plenty of work still left to be done by careful
observers and skilful inquirers, as will be seen from the geographical
list showing approximately the provenance of the more important
contributions to the Kymric folklore in this collection: the counties
will be found to figure very unequally. Thus the anglicizing districts
have helped me very little, while the more Welsh county of Carnarvon
easily takes the lead; but I am inclined to regard the anomalous
features of that list as in a great measure due to accident. In other
words, some neighbourhoods have been luckier than others in having
produced or attracted men who paid attention to local folklore; and if
other counties were to be worked equally with Carnarvonshire, some of
them would probably be found <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e223"
href="#xd25e223" name="xd25e223">ix</a>]</span>not much less rich in
their yield. The anglicizing counties in particular are apt to be
disregarded both from the Welsh and the English points of view, in
folklore just as in some other things; and in this connexion I cannot
help mentioning the premature death of the Rev. Elias Owen as a loss
which Welsh folklorists will not soon cease to regret.</p>
<p>My information has been obtained partly viva voce, partly by letter.
In the case of the stories written down for me in Welsh, I may mention
that in some instances the language is far from good; but it has not
been thought expedient to alter it in any way, beyond introducing some
consistency into the spelling. In the case of the longest specimen of
the written stories, Mr. J. C. Hughes&rsquo; Curse of Pantannas, it is
worthy of notice in passing, that the rendering of it into English was
followed by a version in blank verse by Sir Lewis Morris, who published
it in his <i>Songs of Britain</i>. With regard to the work generally,
my original intention was to publish the materials, obtained in the way
described, with such stories already in print as might be deemed
necessary by way of setting for them; and to let any theories or
deductions in which I might be disposed to indulge follow later. In
this way the first six chapters and portions of some of the others
appeared from time to time in the publications of the Honourable
Society of Cymmrodorion and in those of the Folk-Lore Society. This
would have allowed me to divide the present work into the two well
marked sections of materials and deductions. But, when the earlier part
came to be edited, I found that I had a good deal of fresh material at
my disposal, so that the chapters in question had in some instances to
be considerably lengthened and in some others modified in other ways.
Then as to the deductive half of the work, it may be mentioned that
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e230" href="#xd25e230" name=
"xd25e230">x</a>]</span>certain portions of the folklore, though ever
apt to repeat themselves, were found when closely scrutinized to show
serious lacun&aelig;, which had to be filled in the course of the
reasoning suggested by the materials in hand. Thus the idea of the
whole consisting of two distinctly defined sections had to be given up
or else allowed to wait till I should find time to recast it. But I
could no more look forward to any such time than to the eventual
possibility of escaping minor inconsistencies by quietly stepping
through the looking-glass and beginning my work with the index instead
of resting content to make it in the old-fashioned way at the end.
There was, however, a third course, which is only mentioned to be
rejected, and that was to abstain from all further publication; but
what reader of books has ever known any of his authors to adopt
that!</p>
<p>To crown these indiscretions I have to confess that even when most
of what I may call the raw material had been brought together, I had no
clear idea what I was going to do with it; but I had a hazy notion,
that, as in the case of an inveterate talker whose stream of words is
only made the more boisterous by obstruction, once I sat down to write
I should find reasons and arguments flowing in. It may seem as though I
had been secretly conjuring with Vergil&rsquo;s words <i lang=
"la">viresque adquirit eundo</i>. Nothing so deliberate: the world in
which I live swarms with busybodies dying to organize everybody and
everything, and my instinctive opposition to all that order of tyranny
makes me inclined to cherish a somewhat wild sort of free will. Still
the cursory reader would be wrong to take for granted that there is no
method in my madness: should he take the trouble to look for it, he
would find that it has a certain unity of purpose, which has been
worked out in the later chapters; but to spare him that trouble
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e237" href="#xd25e237" name=
"xd25e237">xi</a>]</span>I venture to become my own expositor and to
append the following summary:&mdash;</p>
<p>The materials crowded into the earlier chapters mark out the stories
connected with the fairies, whether of the lakes or of the dry land, as
the richest lode to be exploited in the mine of Celtic folklore. That
work is attempted in the later chapters; and the analysis of what may
briefly be described as the fairy lore given in the earlier ones
carries with it the means of forcing the conviction, that the complex
group of ideas identified with the little people is of more origins
than one; in other words, that it is drawn partly from history and
fact, and partly from the world of imagination and myth. The latter
element proves on examination to be inseparably connected with certain
ancient beliefs in divinities and demons associated, for instance, with
lakes, rivers, and floods. Accordingly, this aspect of fairy lore has
been dealt with in chapters vi and vii: the former is devoted largely
to the materials themselves, while the latter brings the argument to a
conclusion as to the intimate connexion of the fairies with the
water-world. Then comes the turn of the other kind of origin to be
discussed, namely, that which postulates the historical existence of
the fairies as a real race on which have been lavishly superinduced
various impossible attributes. This opens up a considerable vista into
the early ethnology of these islands, and it involves a variety of
questions bearing on the fortunes here of other races. In the series
which suggests itself the fairies come first as the oldest and lowest
people: then comes that which I venture to call Pictish, possessed of a
higher civilization and of warlike instincts. Next come the earlier
Celts of the Goidelic branch, the traces, linguistic and other, of
whose presence in Wales have demanded repeated notice; and last of all
come the other Celts, the linguistic <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd25e241" href="#xd25e241" name="xd25e241">xii</a>]</span>ancestors of
the Welsh and all the other speakers of Brythonic. The development of
these theses, as far as folklore supplies materials, occupies
practically the remaining five chapters. Among the subsidiary questions
raised may be instanced those of magic and the origin of druidism; not
to mention a neglected aspect of the Arthurian legend, the intimate
association of the Arthur of Welsh folklore and tradition with Snowdon,
and Arthur&rsquo;s attitude towards the Goidelic population in his
time.</p>
<p>Lastly, I have the pleasant duty of thanking all those who have
helped me, whether by word of mouth or by letter, whether by reference
to already printed materials or by assistance in any other way: the
names of many of them will be found recorded in their proper places. As
a rule my inquiries met with prompt replies, and I am not aware that
any difficulties were purposely thrown in my way. Nevertheless I have
had difficulties in abundance to encounter, such as the natural shyness
of some of those whom I wished to examine on the subject of their
recollections, and above all the unavoidable difficulty of
cross-questioning those whose information reached me by post. For the
precise value of any evidence bearing on Celtic folklore is almost
impossible to ascertain, unless it can be made the subject of
cross-examination. This arises from the fact that we Celts have a knack
of thinking ourselves in complete accord with what we fancy to be in
the inquirer&rsquo;s mind, so that we are quite capable of misleading
him in perfect good faith. A most apposite instance, deserving of being
placed on record, came under my notice many years ago. In the summer of
1868 I spent several months in Paris, where I met the historian Henri
Martin more than once. On being introduced to him he reminded me that
he had <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e245" href="#xd25e245" name=
"xd25e245">xiii</a>]</span>visited South Wales not long before, and
that he had been delighted to find the peasantry there still believing
in the transmigration of souls. I expressed my surprise, and remarked
that he must be joking. Nothing of the kind, he assured me, as he had
questioned them himself: the fact admitted of no doubt. I expressed
further surprise, but as I perceived that he was proud of the result of
his friendly encounters with my countrymen I never ventured to return
to the subject, though I always wondered what in the world it could
mean. A few years ago, however, I happened to converse with one of the
most charming and accomplished of Welsh ladies, when she chanced to
mention Henri Martin&rsquo;s advent: it turned out that he had visited
Dr. Charles Williams, then the Principal of Jesus College, and that Dr.
Williams introduced him to his friends in South Wales. So M. Martin
arrived among the hospitable friends of the lady talking to me, who had
in fact to act as his interpreter: I never understood that he could
talk much English or any Welsh. Now I have no doubt that M. Martin,
with his fixed ideas about the druids and their teaching, propounded
palpably leading questions for the Welsh people whom he wished to
examine. His fascinating interpreter put them into terse Welsh, and the
whole thing was done. I could almost venture to write out the dialogue,
which gave back to the great Frenchman his own exact notions from the
lips of simple peasants in that subtle non-Aryan syntax, which no Welsh
barrister has ever been able to explain to the satisfaction of a
bewildered English judge trying to administer justice among a people
whom he cannot wholly comprehend.</p>
<p>This will serve to illustrate one of the difficulties with which the
collector of folklore in Wales has <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd25e249" href="#xd25e249" name="xd25e249">xiv</a>]</span>to cope. I
have done my best to reduce the possible extent of the error to which
it might give rise; and it is only fair to say that those whom I
plagued with my questionings bore the tedium of it with patience, and
that to them my thanks are due in a special degree. Neither they,
however, nor I, could reasonably complain, if we found other
folklorists examining other witnesses on points which had already
occupied us; for in such matters one may say with confidence, that
<i>in the multitude of counsellors there is safety</i>.</p>

<p class="first">We are too hasty when we set down our ancestors in the
gross for fools, for the monstrous inconsistencies (as they seem to us)
involved in their creed of witchcraft. In the relations of this visible
world we find them to have been as rational, and shrewd to detect an
historic anomaly, as ourselves. But when once the invisible world was
supposed to be opened, and the lawless agency of bad spirits assumed,
what measures of probability, of decency, of fitness, or
proportion&mdash;of that which distinguishes the likely from the
palpable absurd&mdash;could they have to guide them in the rejection or
admission of any particular testimony? That maidens pined away, wasting
inwardly as their waxen images consumed before a fire&mdash;that corn
was lodged, and cattle lamed&mdash;that whirlwinds uptore in diabolic
revelry the oaks of the forest&mdash;or that spits and kettles only
danced a fearful-innocent vagary about some rustic&rsquo;s kitchen when
no wind was stirring&mdash;were all equally probable where no law of
agency was understood&#8202;&hellip;. There is no law to judge of the
lawless, or canon by which a dream may be criticised.</p>

<p class="first">The chief object of this and several of the following
chapters is to place on record all the matter I can find on the subject
of Welsh lake legends: what I may have to say of them is merely by the
way and sporadic, and I should feel well paid for my trouble if these
contributions should stimulate others to communicate to the public bits
of similar legends, which, possibly, still linger unrecorded among the
mountains of Wales. For it should be clearly understood that all such
things bear on the history of the Welsh, as the history of no people
can be said to have been written so long as its superstitions and
beliefs in past times have not been studied; and those who may think
that the legends here recorded are childish and frivolous, may rest
assured that they bear on questions which could not themselves be
called either childish or frivolous. So, however silly a legend may be
thought, let him who knows such a legend communicate it to somebody who
will place it on record; he will then probably find that it has more
meaning and interest than he had anticipated. <span class=

<p class="first">I find it best to begin by reproducing a story which
has already been placed on record: this appears desirable on account of
its being the most complete of its kind, and the one with which shorter
ones can most readily be compared. I allude to the legend of the Lady
of &#7930;yn y Fan Fach in Carmarthenshire, which I take the liberty of
copying from Mr. Rees of Tonn&rsquo;s version in the introduction to
<i>The Physicians of My&#273;vai</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e5422src" href="#xd25e5422" name="xd25e5422src">1</a>, published
by the Welsh Manuscript Society, at &#7930;andovery, in 1861. There he
says that he wrote it down from the oral recitations, which I suppose
were in Welsh, of John Evans, tiler, of My&#273;fai, David Williams,
Morfa, near My&#273;fai, who was about ninety years old at the time,
and Elizabeth Morgan, of Hen&#7931;ys Lodge, near &#7930;andovery, who
was a native of the same village of My&#273;fai; to this it may be
added that he acknowledges obligations also to Joseph Joseph, Esq.,
F.S.A., Brecon, for collecting particulars from the old inhabitants of
the parish of &#7930;an&#273;eusant. The legend, as given by Mr. Rees
in English, runs as follows, and strongly reminds one in certain parts
of the Story of Undine as given in the German of De la Motte
Fouqu&eacute;, with which it should be compared:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;When the eventful struggle made by the Princes of South Wales
to preserve the independence of their country was drawing to its close
in the twelfth century, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb3" href="#pb3"
name="pb3">3</a>]</span>there lived at Blaensaw&#273;e<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e5476src" href="#xd25e5476" name="xd25e5476src">2</a>
near &#7930;an&#273;eusant, Carmarthenshire, a widowed woman, the
relict of a farmer who had fallen in those disastrous troubles.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The widow had an only son to bring up, but Providence smiled
upon her, and despite her forlorn condition, her live stock had so
increased in course of time, that she could not well depasture them
upon her farm, so she sent a portion of her cattle to graze on the
adjoining Black Mountain, and their most favourite place was near the
small lake called &#7930;yn y Fan Fach, on the north-western side of
the Carmarthenshire Fans.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The son grew up to manhood, and was generally sent by his
mother to look after the cattle on the mountain. One day, in his
peregrinations along the margin of the lake, to his great astonishment,
he beheld, sitting on the unruffled surface of the water, a lady; one
of the most beautiful creatures that mortal eyes ever beheld, her hair
flowed gracefully in ringlets over her shoulders, the tresses of which
she arranged with a comb, whilst the glassy surface of her watery couch
served for the purpose of a mirror, reflecting back her own image.
Suddenly she beheld the young man standing on the brink of the lake,
with his eyes riveted on her, and unconsciously offering to herself the
provision of barley bread and cheese with which he had been provided
when he left his home.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bewildered by a feeling of love and admiration for the object
before him, he continued to hold out his hand towards the lady, who
imperceptibly glided near to him, but gently refused the offer of his
provisions. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb4" href="#pb4" name=
"pb4">4</a>]</span>He attempted to touch her, but she eluded his grasp,
saying&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">

<p class="line"><i>Cras dy fara;</i></p>
<p class="line"><i>Nid haw&#273; fy nala.</i></p>

<p class="line">Hard baked is thy bread!</p>
<p class="line">&rsquo;Tis not easy to catch me<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e5502src" href="#xd25e5502" name="xd25e5502src">3</a>;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">and immediately dived under the water and disappeared,
leaving the love-stricken youth to return home, a prey to
disappointment and regret that he had been unable to make further
acquaintance with one, in comparison with whom the whole of the fair
maidens of &#7930;an&#273;eusant and My&#273;fai<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e5507src" href="#xd25e5507" name="xd25e5507src">4</a> whom he had
ever seen were as nothing.</p>
<p>On his return home the young man communicated to his mother the
extraordinary vision he had beheld. She advised him to take some
unbaked dough or &ldquo;toes&rdquo; the next time in his pocket, as
there must have been some spell connected with the hard-baked bread, or
&ldquo;Bara cras,&rdquo; which prevented his catching the lady.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Next morning, before the sun had gilded with its rays the
peaks of the Fans, the young man was at the lake, not for the purpose
of looking after his mother&rsquo;s cattle, but seeking for the same
enchanting vision he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb5" href="#pb5"
name="pb5">5</a>]</span>had witnessed the day before; but all in vain
did he anxiously strain his eyeballs and glance over the surface of the
lake, as only the ripples occasioned by a stiff breeze met his view,
and a cloud hung heavily on the summit of the Fan, which imparted an
additional gloom to his already distracted mind.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hours passed on, the wind was hushed, and the clouds which
had enveloped the mountain had vanished into thin air before the
powerful beams of the sun, when the youth was startled by seeing some
of his mother&rsquo;s cattle on the precipitous side of the acclivity,
nearly on the opposite side of the lake. His duty impelled him to
attempt to rescue them from their perilous position, for which purpose
he was hastening away, when, to his inexpressible delight, the object
of his search again appeared to him as before, and seemed much more
beautiful than when he first beheld her. His hand was again held out to
her, full of unbaked bread, which he offered with an urgent proffer of
his heart also, and vows of eternal attachment. All of which were
refused by her, saying&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div lang="cy" class="lg">
<p class="line"><i>&#7930;aith dy fara!</i></p>
<p class="line"><i>Ti ni fynna&rsquo;.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Unbaked is thy bread!</p>
<p class="line">I will not have thee<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e5582src" href="#xd25e5582" name="xd25e5582src">5</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">But the smiles that played upon her features as the
lady vanished beneath the waters raised within the young man a hope
that forbade him to despair by her refusal of him, and the recollection
of which cheered him on his way home. His aged parent was made
acquainted with his ill-success, and she suggested that his bread
should next time be but slightly baked, as most likely to please the
mysterious being of whom he had become enamoured.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Impelled by an irresistible feeling, the youth left
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb6" href="#pb6" name=
"pb6">6</a>]</span>his mother&rsquo;s house early next morning, and
with rapid steps he passed over the mountain. He was soon near the
margin of the lake, and with all the impatience of an ardent lover did
he wait with a feverish anxiety for the reappearance of the mysterious
lady.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The sheep and goats browsed on the precipitous sides of the
Fan; the cattle strayed amongst the rocks and large stones, some of
which were occasionally loosened from their beds and suddenly rolled
down into the lake; rain and sunshine alike came and passed away; but
all were unheeded by the youth, so wrapped up was he in looking for the
appearance of the lady.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The freshness of the early morning had disappeared before the
sultry rays of the noon-day sun, which in its turn was fast verging
towards the west as the evening was dying away and making room for the
shades of night, and hope had wellnigh abated of beholding once more
the Lady of the Lake. The young man cast a sad and last farewell look
over the waters, and, to his astonishment, beheld several cows walking
along its surface. The sight of these animals caused hope to revive
that they would be followed by another object far more pleasing; nor
was he disappointed, for the maiden reappeared, and to his enraptured
sight, even lovelier than ever. She approached the land, and he rushed
to meet her in the water. A smile encouraged him to seize her hand;
neither did she refuse the moderately baked bread he offered her; and
after some persuasion she consented to become his bride, on condition
that they should only live together until she received from him three
blows without a cause,</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div lang="cy" class="lg">
<p class="line"><i>Tri ergyd diachos.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Three causeless blows.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">And if he ever should happen to strike her three such
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb7" href="#pb7" name=
"pb7">7</a>]</span>blows she would leave him for ever. To such
conditions he readily consented, and would have consented to any other
stipulation, had it been proposed, as he was only intent on then
securing such a lovely creature for his wife.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thus the Lady of the Lake engaged to become the young
man&rsquo;s wife, and having loosed her hand for a moment she darted
away and dived into the lake. His chagrin and grief were such that he
determined to cast himself headlong into the deepest water, so as to
end his life in the element that had contained in its unfathomed depths
the only one for whom he cared to live on earth. As he was on the point
of committing this rash act, there emerged out of the lake <i>two</i>
most beautiful ladies, accompanied by a hoary-headed man of noble mien
and extraordinary stature, but having otherwise all the force and
strength of youth. This man addressed the almost bewildered youth in
accents calculated to soothe his troubled mind, saying that as he
proposed to marry one of his daughters, he consented to the union,
provided the young man could distinguish which of the two ladies before
him was the object of his affections. This was no easy task, as the
maidens were such perfect counterparts of each other that it seemed
quite impossible for him to choose his bride, and if perchance he fixed
upon the wrong one all would be for ever lost.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Whilst the young man narrowly scanned the two ladies, he
could not perceive the least difference betwixt the two, and was almost
giving up the task in despair, when one of them thrust her foot a
slight degree forward. The motion, simple as it was, did not escape the
observation of the youth, and he discovered a trifling variation in the
mode with which their sandals were tied. This at once put an end to the
dilemma, for he, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb8" href="#pb8" name=
"pb8">8</a>]</span>who had on previous occasions been so taken up with
the general appearance of the Lady of the Lake, had also noticed the
beauty of her feet and ankles, and on now recognizing the peculiarity
of her shoe-tie he boldly took hold of her hand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&#8202;&ldquo;Thou hast chosen rightly,&rdquo; said her
father; &ldquo;be to her a kind and faithful husband, and I will give
her, as a dowry, as many sheep, cattle, goats, and horses as she can
count of each without heaving or drawing in her breath. But remember,
that if you prove unkind to her at any time, and strike her three times
without a cause, she shall return to me, and shall bring all her stock
back with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Such was the verbal marriage settlement, to which the young
man gladly assented, and his bride was desired to count the number of
sheep she was to have. She immediately adopted the mode of counting by
<i>fives</i>, thus:&mdash;One, two, three, four, five&mdash;One, two,
three, four, five; as many times as possible in rapid succession, till
her breath was exhausted. The same process of reckoning had to
determine the number of goats, cattle, and horses respectively; and in
an instant the full number of each came out of the lake when called
upon by the father.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The young couple were then married, by what ceremony was not
stated, and afterwards went to reside at a farm called Esgair
&#7930;aethdy, somewhat more than a mile from the village of
My&#273;fai, where they lived in prosperity and happiness for several
years, and became the parents of three sons, who were beautiful
children.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Once upon a time there was a christening to take place in the
neighbourhood, to which the parents were specially invited. When the
day arrived the wife appeared very reluctant to attend the christening,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb9" href="#pb9" name=
"pb9">9</a>]</span>alleging that the distance was too great for her to
walk. Her husband told her to fetch one of the horses which were
grazing in an adjoining field. &ldquo;I will,&rdquo; said she,
&ldquo;if you will bring me my gloves which I left in our house.&rdquo;
He went to the house and returned with the gloves, and finding that she
had not gone for the horse jocularly slapped her shoulder with one of
them, saying, &ldquo;go! go!&rdquo; (<i lang="cy">dos, dos</i>), when
she reminded him of the understanding upon which she consented to marry
him:&mdash;That he was not to strike her without a cause; and warned
him to be more cautious for the future.</p>
<p>&lsquo;On another occasion, when they were together at a wedding, in
the midst of the mirth and hilarity of the assembled guests, who had
gathered together from all the surrounding country, she burst into
tears and sobbed most piteously. Her husband touched her on her
shoulder and inquired the cause of her weeping: she said, &ldquo;Now
people are entering into trouble, and your troubles are likely to
commence, as you have the <i>second</i> time stricken me without a
cause.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Years passed on, and their children had grown up, and were
particularly clever young men. In the midst of so many worldly
blessings at home the husband almost forgot that there remained only
<i>one</i> causeless blow to be given to destroy the whole of his
prosperity. Still he was watchful lest any trivial occurrence should
take place which his wife must regard as a breach of their marriage
contract. She told him, as her affection for him was unabated, to be
careful that he would not, through some inadvertence, give the last and
only blow, which, by an unalterable destiny, over which she had no
control, would separate them for ever.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It, however, so happened that one day they were together at a
funeral, where, in the midst of the mourning and grief at the house of
the deceased, she appeared <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb10" href=
"#pb10" name="pb10">10</a>]</span>in the highest and gayest spirits,
and indulged in immoderate fits of laughter, which so shocked her
husband that he touched her, saying, &ldquo;Hush! hush! don&rsquo;t
laugh.&rdquo; She said that she laughed &ldquo;because people when they
die go out of trouble,&rdquo; and, rising up, she went out of the
house, saying, &ldquo;The last blow has been struck, our marriage
contract is broken, and at an end! Farewell!&rdquo; Then she started
off towards Esgair &#7930;aethdy, where she called her cattle and other
stock together, each by name. The cattle she called thus:&mdash;</p>

<p class="first">They all immediately obeyed the summons of their
mistress. The &ldquo;little black calf,&rdquo; although it had been
slaughtered, became alive again, and walked off with the rest of the
stock at the command of the lady. This happened in the spring of the
year, and there were four oxen ploughing in one of the fields; to these
she cried:&mdash;</p>

<p class="line">That are on the field,</p>
<p class="line">Come you also</p>
<p class="line">Quite well home!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">Away the whole of the live stock went with the Lady
across My&#273;fai Mountain, towards the lake from whence they came, a
distance of above six miles, where they disappeared beneath its waters,
leaving no trace behind except a well-marked furrow, which was made by
the plough the oxen drew after them into the lake, and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb11" href="#pb11" name="pb11">11</a>]</span>which
remains to this day as a testimony to the truth of this story.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What became of the affrighted ploughman&mdash;whether he was
left on the field when the oxen set off, or whether he followed them to
the lake, has not been handed down to tradition; neither has the fate
of the disconsolate and half-ruined husband been kept in remembrance.
But of the sons it is stated that they often wandered about the lake
and its vicinity, hoping that their mother might be permitted to visit
the face of the earth once more, as they had been apprised of her
mysterious origin, her first appearance to their father, and the
untoward circumstances which so unhappily deprived them of her maternal
care.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In one of their rambles, at a place near D&ocirc;l Howel, at
the Mountain Gate, still called &ldquo;&#7930;idiad y
Me&#273;ygon,&rdquo; The Physicians&rsquo; Gate, the mother appeared
suddenly, and accosted her eldest son, whose name was Rhiwa&#7931;on,
and told him that his mission on earth was to be a benefactor to
mankind by relieving them from pain and misery, through healing all
manner of their diseases; for which purpose she furnished him with a
bag full of medical prescriptions and instructions for the preservation
of health. That by strict attention thereto he and his family would
become for many generations the most skilful physicians in the country.
Then, promising to meet him when her counsel was most needed, she
vanished. But on several occasions she met her sons near the banks of
the lake, and once she even accompanied them on their return home as
far as a place still called &ldquo;Pant-y-Me&#273;ygon,&rdquo; The
dingle of the Physicians, where she pointed out to them the various
plants and herbs which grew in the dingle, and revealed to them their
medicinal qualities or virtues; and the knowledge she imparted to them,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href="#pb12" name=
"pb12">12</a>]</span>together with their unrivalled skill, soon caused
them to attain such celebrity that none ever possessed before them. And
in order that their knowledge should not be lost, they wisely committed
the same to writing, for the benefit of mankind throughout all
ages.&rsquo;</p>
<p>To the legend Mr. Rees added the following notes, which we reproduce
also at full length:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And so ends the story of the Physicians of My&#273;fai, which
has been handed down from one generation to another, thus:&mdash;</p>

</div>
<p class="first">As stated in the introduction of the present work
[i.e. <i>the Physicians of My&#273;vai</i>], Rhiwa&#7931;on and his
sons became Physicians to Rhys Gryg, Lord of &#7930;andovery and
Dynefor Castles, &ldquo;who gave them rank, lands, and privileges at
My&#273;fai for their maintenance in the practice of their art and
science, and the healing and benefit of those who should seek their
help,&rdquo; thus affording to those who could not afford to pay, the
best medical advice and treatment gratuitously. Such a truly royal
foundation could not fail to produce corresponding effects. So the fame
of the Physicians of My&#273;fai was soon established over the whole
country, and continued for centuries among their descendants.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The celebrated Welsh Bard, Dafy&#273; ap Gwilym, who
flourished in the following century, and was buried at the Abbey of
Tal-y-&#7931;ychau<a class="noteref" id="xd25e5801src" href=
"#xd25e5801" name="xd25e5801src">7</a>, in Carmarthenshire,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb13" href="#pb13" name=

quoted in Dr. Davies&rsquo; dictionary&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div lang="cy" class="lg">
<p class="line"><i>Me&#273;yg ni wnai mo&#273; y gwnaeth</i></p>

</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">A Physician he would not make</p>
<p class="line">As My&#273;fai made, if he had a mead fostered man.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">Of the above lands bestowed upon the Me&#273;ygon,
there are two farms in My&#273;fai parish still called
&ldquo;&#7930;wyn Ifan Fe&#273;yg,&rdquo; the Grove of Evan the
Physician; and &ldquo;&#7930;wyn Meredy&#273; Fe&#273;yg,&rdquo; the
Grove of Meredith the Physician. Esgair &#7930;aethdy, mentioned in the
foregoing legend, was formerly in the possession of the above
descendants, and so was Ty newy&#273;, near My&#273;fai, which was
purchased by Mr. Holford, of Cilgwyn, from the Rev. Charles Lloyd,
vicar of &#7930;andefa&#7931;e, Breconshire, who married a daughter of
one of the Me&#273;ygon, and had the living of &#7930;andefa&#7931;e
from a Mr. Vaughan, who presented him to the same out of gratitude,
because Mr. Lloyd&rsquo;s wife&rsquo;s father had cured him of a
disease in the eye. As Mr. Lloyd succeeded to the above living in 1748,
and died in 1800, it is probable that the skilful oculist was John
Jones, who is mentioned in the following inscription on a tombstone at
present fixed against the west end of My&#273;fai Church:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first xd25e118">HERE<br>
Lieth the body of Mr. DAVID JONES, of Mothvey, Surgeon,<br>
who was an honest, charitable, and skilful man.<br>
He died September 14th, Anno Dom&#771; 1719, aged 61.</p>
<p class="xd25e118">JOHN JONES, Surgeon,<br>
Eldest son of the said David Jones, departed this life<br>
the 25th of November, 1739, in the 44th year<br>
of his Age, and also lyes interred hereunder.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These appear to have been the last of the Physicians who practised
at My&#273;fai. The above John Jones resided for some time at
&#7930;andovery, and was a very eminent surgeon. One of his
descendants, named <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href="#pb14"
name="pb14">14</a>]</span>John Lewis, lived at Cwmbran, My&#273;fai, at
which place his great-grandson, Mr. John Jones, now resides.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dr. Morgan Owen, Bishop of &#7930;andaff, who died at
Glasa&#7931;t, parish of My&#273;fai, in 1645, was a descendant of the
Me&#273;ygon, and an inheritor of much of their landed property in that
parish, the bulk of which he bequeathed to his nephew, Morgan Owen, who
died in 1667, and was succeeded by his son Henry Owen; and at the
decease of the last of whose descendants, Robert Lewis, Esq., the
estates became, through the will of one of the family, the property of
the late D. A. S. Davies, Esq., M.P. for Carmarthenshire.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bishop Owen bequeathed to another nephew, Morgan ap Rees, son
of Rees ap John, a descendant of the Me&#273;ygon, the farm of Rhyblid,
and some other property. Morgan ap Rees&rsquo; son, Samuel Rice,
resided at Loughor, in Gower, Glamorganshire, and had a son, Morgan
Rice, who was a merchant in London, and became Lord of the Manor of
Tooting Graveney, and High Sheriff in the year 1772, and Deputy
Lieutenant of the county of Surrey, 1776. He resided at Hill House,
which he built. At his death the whole of his property passed to his
only child, John Rice, Esq., whose eldest son, the Rev. John Morgan
Rice, inherited the greater portion of his estates. The head of the
family is now the Rev. Horatio Morgan Rice, rector of South Hill with
Callington, Cornwall, and J.P. for the county, who inherited, with
other property, a small estate at Loughor. The above Morgan Rice had
landed property in &#7930;anmadock and &#7930;angenith, as well as
Loughor, in Gower, but whether he had any connexion with Howel the
Physician (ap Rhys ap &#7930;ywelyn ap Philip the Physician, and lineal
descendant from Einion ap Rhiwa&#7931;on), who resided at Cilgwryd in
Gower, is not known. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href="#pb15"
name="pb15">15</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;Amongst other families who claim descent from the Physicians
were the Bowens of Cwmydw, My&#273;fai; and Jones of Dollgarreg and
Penrhock, in the same parish; the latter of whom are represented by
Charles Bishop, of Dollgarreg, Esq., Clerk of the Peace for
Carmarthenshire, and Thomas Bishop, of Brecon, Esq.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Rees Williams of My&#273;fai is recorded as one of the
Me&#273;ygon. His great-grandson was the late Rice Williams, M.D., of
Aberystwyth, who died May 16, 1842, aged 85, and appears to have been
the last, although not the least eminent, of the Physicians descended
from the mysterious Lady of &#7930;yn y Fan<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e5855src" href="#xd25e5855" name="xd25e5855src">8</a>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This brings the legend of the Lady of the Fan Lake into connexion
with a widely-spread family. There is another connexion between it and
modern times, as will be seen from the following statement kindly made
to me by the Rev. A. G. Edwards, Warden of the Welsh College at
&#7930;andovery, since then appointed Bishop of St. Asaph: &lsquo;An
old woman from My&#273;fai, who is now, that is to say in January 1881,
about eighty years of age, tells me that she remembers &ldquo;thousands
and thousands of people visiting the Lake of the Little Fan on the
first Sunday or Monday in August, and when she was young she often
heard old men declare that at that time a commotion took place in the
lake, and that its waters boiled, which was taken to herald the
approach of the Lake Lady and her Oxen.&rdquo;&#8202;&rsquo; The custom
of going up to the lake on the first Sunday in August was a very well
known one in years gone by, as I have learned from a good many people,
and it is corroborated by Mr. Joseph Joseph of Brecon, who kindly
writes as follows, in reply to some queries <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb16" href="#pb16" name="pb16">16</a>]</span>of mine:
&lsquo;On the first Sunday in the month of August, &#7930;yn y Fan Fach
is supposed to be boiling (<i lang="cy">berwi</i>). I have seen scores
of people going up to see it (not boiling though) on that day. I do not
remember that any of them expected to see the Lady of the Lake.&rsquo;
As to the boiling of the lake I have nothing to say, and I am not sure
that there is anything in the following statement made as an
explanation of the yearly visit to the lake by an old fisherwoman from
&#7930;andovery: &lsquo;The best time for eels is in August, when the
north-east wind blows on the lake, and makes huge waves in it. The eels
can then be seen floating on the waves.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Last summer I went myself to the village of My&#273;fai, to see if I
could pick up any variants of the legend, but I was hardly successful;
for though several of the farmers I questioned could repeat bits of the
legend, including the Lake Lady&rsquo;s call to her cattle as she went
away, I got nothing new, except that one of them said that the youth,
when he first saw the Lake Lady at a distance, thought she was a
goose&mdash;he did not even rise to the conception of a swan&mdash;but
that by degrees he approached her, and discovered that she was a lady
in white, and that in due time they were married, and so on. My friend,
the Warden of &#7930;andovery College, seems, however, to have found a
bit of a version which may have been still more unlike the one recorded
by Mr. Rees of Tonn: it was from an old man at My&#273;fai last year,
from whom he was, nevertheless, only able to extract the statement
&lsquo;that the Lake Lady got somehow entangled in a farmer&rsquo;s
&ldquo;gambo,&rdquo; and that ever after his farm was very
fertile.&rsquo; A &lsquo;gambo,&rsquo; I ought to explain, is a kind of
a cart without sides, used in South Wales: both the name and the thing
seem to have come from England, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb17"
href="#pb17" name="pb17">17</a>]</span>though I cannot find such a word
as <i>gambo</i> or <i>gambeau</i> in the ordinary dictionaries.</p>
<p>Among other legends about lake fairies, there are, in the third
chapter of Mr. Sikes&rsquo; <i>British Goblins</i>, two versions of
this story: the first of them differs but slightly from Mr.
Rees&rsquo;, in that the farmer used to go near the lake to see some
lambs he had bought at a fair, and that whenever he did so three
beautiful damsels appeared to him from the lake. They always eluded his
attempts to catch them: they ran away into the lake, saying, <i lang=
"cy">Cras dy fara</i>, &amp;c. But one day a piece of moist bread came
floating ashore, which he ate, and the next day he had a chat with the
Lake Maidens. He proposed marriage to one of them, to which she
consented, provided he could distinguish her from her sisters the day
after. The story then, so far as I can make out from the brief version
which Mr. Sikes gives of it, went on like that of Mr. Rees. The former
gives another version, with much more interesting variations, which
omit all reference, however, to the Physicians of My&#273;fai, and
relate how a young farmer had heard of the Lake Maiden rowing up and
down the lake in a golden boat with a golden scull. He went to the lake
on New Year&rsquo;s Eve, saw her, was fascinated by her, and left in
despair at her vanishing out of sight, although he cried out to her to
stay and be his wife. She faintly replied, and went her way, after he
had gazed at her long yellow hair and pale melancholy face. He
continued to visit the lake, and grew thin and negligent of his person,
owing to his longing. But a wise man, who lived on the mountain,
advised him to tempt her with gifts of bread and cheese, which he
undertook to do on Midsummer Eve, when he dropped into the lake a large
cheese and a loaf of bread. This he did repeatedly, until at last
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href="#pb18" name=
"pb18">18</a>]</span>his hopes were fulfilled on New Year&rsquo;s Eve.
This time he had gone to the lake clad in his best suit, and at
midnight dropped seven white loaves and his biggest and finest cheese
into the lake. The Lake Lady by-and-by came in her skiff to where he
was, and gracefully stepped ashore. The scene need not be further
described: Mr. Sikes gives a picture of it, and the story then proceeds
as in the other version.</p>
<p>It is a pity that Mr. Rees did not preserve the Welsh versions out
of which he pieced together the English one; but as to Mr. Sikes, I
cannot discover whence his has been derived, for he seems not to have
been too anxious to leave anybody the means of testing his work, as one
will find on verifying his references, when he gives any. See also the
allusions to him in Hartland&rsquo;s <i>Science of Fairy Tales</i>, pp.
64, 123, 137, 165, 278.</p>
<p>Since writing the foregoing notes the following communication has
reached me from a friend of my undergraduate days at Jesus College,
Oxford, Mr. &#7930;ywarch Reynolds of Merthyr Tydfil. Only the first
part of it concerns the legend of &#7930;yn y Fan Fach; but as the rest
is equally racy I make no apology for publishing it in full without any
editing, except the insertion of the meaning of two or three of the
Welsh words occurring in it:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tell Rh&#375;s that I have just heard a sequel to the
Me&#273;ygon My&#273;fai story, got from a rustic on Myny&#273; y
Banwen, between Glynn&ecirc;&#273; and Glyntaw&euml;, on a ramble
recently with David Lewis the barrister and Sidney Hartland the
folklorist. It was to the effect that after the disappearance of the
<i lang="cy">forwn</i>, &ldquo;the damsel,&rdquo; into the lake, the
disconsolate husband and his friends set to work to drain the lake in
order to get at her, if possible. They made a great cutting into the
bank, when suddenly a huge hairy monster of hideous aspect <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href="#pb19" name="pb19">19</a>]</span>emerged
from the water and stormed at them for disturbing him, and wound up
with this threat:&mdash;</p>

<p class="first">It was evidently the last <i lang="cy">braich</i>,
&ldquo;arm,&rdquo; of a <i lang="cy">Triban Morgannwg</i>, but this was
all my informant knew of it. From the allusion to <i lang=
"cy">Tre&rsquo; Byrhon&#273;u</i>, it struck me that there was here
probably a tale of <i lang="cy">&#7930;yn Safa&#273;on</i>, which had
migrated to <i lang="cy">&#7930;yn y Fan</i>; because of course there
would have to be a considerable change in the &ldquo;levels&rdquo;
before <i lang="cy">&#7930;yn y Fan</i> and the <i lang=

"noteref" id="xd25e5938src" href="#xd25e5938" name=
"xd25e5938src">9</a>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We also got another tale about a <i lang="cy">cwmshurwr</i>,
&ldquo;conjurer,&rdquo; who once lived in Ystradgyrlais (as the rustic
pronounced it). The wizard was a <i lang="cy">dyn &#7931;aw-harn</i>,
&ldquo;a man with an iron hand&rdquo;; and it being reported that there
was a great treasure hidden in Myny&#273; y Drum, the wizard said he
would secure it, if he could but get some plucky fellow to spend a
night with him there. John Gethin was a plucky fellow (<i lang="cy">dyn
&ldquo;ysprydol&rdquo;</i>), and he agreed to join the <i lang="cy">dyn
&#7931;aw-harn</i> in his <i>diablerie</i>. The wizard traced two rings
on the sward touching each other &ldquo;like a number 8&rdquo;; he went
into one, and Gethin into the other, the wizard strictly charging him
on no account to step out of the ring. The <i lang=
"cy">&#7931;aw-harn</i> then proceeded to <i lang="cy">trafod &rsquo;i
lyfrau</i>, or &ldquo;busy himself with his books&rdquo;; and there
soon appeared a monstrous bull, bellowing dreadfully; but the plucky
Gethin held his ground, and the bull vanished. Next came a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb20" href="#pb20" name="pb20">20</a>]</span>terrible
object, a &ldquo;fly-wheel of fire,&rdquo; which made straight for poor
Gethin and made him swerve out of the ring. Thereupon the wheel assumed
the form of the <i lang="cy">diawl</i>, &ldquo;devil,&rdquo; who began
to haul Gethin away. The <i lang="cy">&#7931;aw-harn</i> seized hold of
him and tried to get him back. The devil was getting the upper hand,
when the <i lang="cy">&#7931;aw-harn</i> begged the devil to let him
keep Gethin while the piece of candle he had with him lasted. The devil
consented, and let go his hold of Gethin, whereupon the <i lang=
"cy">cwmshurwr</i> immediately blew out the candle, and the devil was
discomfited. Gethin preserved the piece of candle very carefully,
stowing it away in a cool place; but still it wasted away although it
was never lighted. Gethin got such a fright that he took to his bed,
and as the candle wasted away he did the same, and they both came to an
end simultaneously. Gethin vanished&mdash;and it was not his body that
was put into the coffin, but a lump of clay which was put in to save
appearances! It is said that the wizard&rsquo;s books are in an oaken
chest at Waungyrlais farm house to this day.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We got these tales on a ramble to see &ldquo;Maen y
Gwe&#273;iau,&rdquo; on the mountain near Coelbren Junction Station on
the Neath and Brecon Railway (marked on the Ordnance Map), but we had
to turn back owing to the fearful heat.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Before dismissing Mr. Reynolds&rsquo; letter I may mention a story
in point which relates to a lake on the Brecon side of the mountains.
It is given at length by the Rev. Edward Davies in his <i>Mythology and
Rites of the British Druids</i> (London, 1809), pp. 155&ndash;7.
According to this legend a door in the rock was to be found open once a
year&mdash;on May-day, as it is supposed&mdash;and from that door one
could make one&rsquo;s way to the garden of the fairies, which was an
island in the middle of the lake. This paradise of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb21" href="#pb21" name=
"pb21">21</a>]</span>exquisite bliss was invisible, however, to those
who stood outside the lake: they could only see an indistinct mass in
the centre of the water. Once on a time a visitor tried to carry away
some of the flowers given him by the fairies, but he was thereby acting
against their law, and not only was he punished with the loss of his
senses, but the door has never since been left open. It is also related
that once an adventurous person attempted to drain the water away
&lsquo;in order to discover its contents, when a terrific form arose
from the midst of the lake, commanding him to desist, or otherwise he
would drown the country.&rsquo; This form is clearly of the same
species as that which, according to Mr. Reynolds&rsquo; story,
threatened to drown the town of Brecon. Subsequent inquiries have
elicited more information, and I am more especially indebted to my
friend Mr. Ivor James, who, as registrar of the University of Wales,
has of late years been living at Brecon. He writes to the following
effect:&mdash;&lsquo;The lake you want is &#7930;yn Cwm &#7930;wch, and
the legend is very well known locally, but there are variants. Once on
a time men and boys dug a gully through the dam in order to let the
water out. A man in a red coat, sitting in an armchair, appeared on the
surface of the water and threatened them in the terms which you quote
from Mr. Reynolds. The red coat would seem to suggest that this form of
the legend dates possibly from a time since our soldiers were first
clothed in red. In another case, however, the spectre was that of an
old woman; and I am told that a somewhat similar story is told in
connexion with a well in the castle wall in the parish of
&#7930;an&#273;ew, to the north of this town&mdash;Giraldus
Cambrensis&rsquo; parish. A friend of mine is employing his spare time
at present in an inquiry into the origin of the lakes of this
<span class="corr" id="xd25e6005" title=
"Source: distriet">district</span>, and he tells me that &#7930;yn
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb22" href="#pb22" name=
"pb22">22</a>]</span>Cwm &#7930;wch is of glacial origin, its dam being
composed, as he thinks, of glacial d&eacute;bris through which the
water always percolates into the valley below. But storm water flows
over the dam, and in the course of ages has cut for itself a gully, now
about ten feet deep at the deepest point, through the embankment. The
story was possibly invented to explain that fact. There is no cave to
be seen in the rock, and probably there never was one, as the formation
is the Old Red Sandstone; and the island was perhaps equally
imaginary.&rsquo;</p>
<p>That is the substance of Mr. James&rsquo; letter, in which he,
moreover, refers to J. D. Rhys&rsquo; account of the lake in his Welsh
introduction to his Grammar, published in London in 1592, under the
title <i lang="la">Cambrobrytannic&aelig; Cymraec&aelig;ve Lingu&aelig;
Institutiones et Rudimenta</i>. There the grammarian, in giving some
account of himself, mentions his frequent sojourns at the hospitable
residence of a nobleman, named M. Morgan Mer&ecirc;dydh, near <i lang=
"cy">y Bugeildy ynn Nyphryn Tabh&icirc;da o bhywn Swydh Bhaesybhed</i>,
that is, &lsquo;near the Beguildy in the Valley of the Teme within the
county of Radnor.&rsquo; Then he continues to the following
effect:&mdash;&lsquo;But the latter part of this book was thought out
under the bushes and green foliage in a bit of a place of my own called
y Clun H&icirc;r, at the top of Cwm y &#7930;wch, below the spurs of
the mountain of Bannwchdeni, which some call Bann Arthur and others
Moel Arthur. Below that <i lang="cy">moel</i> and in its lap there is a
lake of pretty large size, unknown depth, and wondrous nature. For as
the stories go, no bird has ever been seen to repair to it or towards
it, or to swim on it: it is wholly avoided, and some say that no
animals or beasts of any kind are wont to drink of its waters. The
peasantry of that country, and especially the shepherds who are wont to
frequent these <i>moels</i> and <i>bans</i>, relate many other wonders
concerning it and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb23" href="#pb23"

<p class="first">Before dismissing the story of &#7930;yn y Fan Fach I
wish to append a similar one from the parish of Ystrad Dyfodwg in
Glamorganshire. The following is a translation of a version given in
Welsh in <i lang="cy">Cyfai&#7931; yr Aelwyd a&rsquo;r Frythones</i>,
edited by Elfed and Cadrawd, and published by Messrs. Williams and Son,
&#7930;ane&#7931;y. The version in question is by Cadrawd, and it is to
the following effect&mdash;see the volume for 1892, p. 59:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&#7930;yn y Forwyn, &ldquo;the Damsel&rsquo;s Pool,&rdquo; is
in the parish of Ystrad Tyfodwg: the inhabitants call it also &#7930;yn
Nelferch. It lies about halfway between the farm house of Rhon&#273;a
Fechan, &ldquo;Little Rhon&#273;a,&rdquo; and the Vale of Safrwch. The
ancient tradition concerning it is somewhat as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Once on a time a farmer lived at the Rhon&#273;a Fechan: he
was unmarried, and as he was walking by the lake early one morning in
spring he beheld a young woman of beautiful appearance walking on the
other side of it. He approached her and spoke to her: she gave him to
understand that her home was in the lake, and that she owned a number
of milch cows, that lived with her at the bottom of the water. The
farmer fancied her so much that he fell in love with her over head and
ears: he asked her on the spot for her hand and heart; and he invited
her to come and spend her life with him as his wife at the Rhon&#273;a
Fechan. She declined at first, but as he was importunate she consented
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb24" href="#pb24" name=
"pb24">24</a>]</span>at last on the following conditions, namely, that
she would bring her cattle with her out of the lake, and live with him
until he and she had three disputes with one another: then, she said,
she and the cattle would return into the lake. He agreed to the
conditions, and the marriage took place. They lived very happily and
comfortably for long years; but the end was that they fell out with one
another, and, when they happened to have quarrelled for the third time,
she was heard early in the morning driving the cattle towards the lake
with these words:&mdash;</p>
<div lang="cy" class="lgouter">
<p class="line"><i>Prw dre&rsquo;, prw dre&rsquo;, prw&rsquo;r gwartheg

"xd25e6079src">11</a>.</i></p>
</div>
<p class="first">And into the lake they went out of sight, and there
they live to this day. And some believed that they had heard the voice
and cry of Nelferch in the whisper of the breeze on the top of the
mountain hard by&mdash;many a time after that&mdash;as an old story
(<i lang="cy">we&#273;al</i>) will have it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>From this it will be seen that the fairy wife&rsquo;s name was
supposed to have been Nelferch, and that the piece of water is called
after her. But I find that great uncertainty prevails as to the old
name of the lake, as I learn from a communication in 1894 from
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href="#pb25" name=
"pb25">25</a>]</span>Mr. &#7930;ewellyn Williams, living at Porth, only
some five miles from the spot, that one of his informants assured him
that the name in use among former generations was <i lang=
"cy">&#7930;yn Alfach</i>. Mr. Williams made inquiries at the
Rhon&#273;a Fechan about the lake legend. He was told that the water
had long since been known as &#7930;yn y Forwyn, from a <i lang=
"cy">morwyn</i>, or damsel, with a number of cattle having been drowned
in it. The story of the man who mentioned the name as &#7930;yn Alfach
was similar: the maid belonged to the farm of Penrhys, he said, and the
young man to the Rhon&#273;a Fechan, and it was in consequence of their
third dispute, he added, that she left him and went back to her
previous service, and afterwards, while taking the cattle to the water,
she sank accidentally or purposely into the lake, so that she was never
found any more. Here it will be seen how modern rationalism has been
modifying the story into something quite uninteresting but without
wholly getting rid of the original features, such as the three disputes
between the husband and wife. Lastly, it is worth mentioning that this
water appears to form part of a bit of very remarkable scenery, and
that its waves strike on one side against a steep rock believed to
contain caves, supposed to have been formerly inhabited by men and
women. At present the place, I learn, is in the possession of Messrs.
Davis and Sons, owners of the Ferndale collieries, who keep a pleasure
boat on the lake. I have appealed to them on the question of the name
Nelferch or Alfach, in the hope that their books would help to decide
as to the old form of it. Replying on their behalf, Mr. J. Probert
Evans informs me that the company only got possession of the lake and
the adjacent land in 1862, and that &lsquo;<span lang="cy">&#7930;yn y
Vorwyn</span>&rsquo; is the name of the former in the oldest plan which
they have. Inquiries have also been made <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb26" href="#pb26" name="pb26">26</a>]</span>in the neighbourhood by
my friend, Mr. Reynolds, who found the old tenants of the Rhon&#273;a
Fechan Farm gone, and the neighbouring farm house of Dyffryn Safrwch
supplanted by colliers&rsquo; cottages. But he calls my attention to
the fact, that perhaps the old name was neither Nelferch nor Alfach, as
Elfarch, which would fit equally well, was once the name of a petty
chieftain of the adjoining Hundred of Sengheny&#273;, for which he
refers me to Clark&rsquo;s <i>Glamorgan Genealogies</i>, p. 511. But I
have to thank him more especially for a longer version of the fairy
wife&rsquo;s call to her cattle, as given in Glanffrwd&rsquo;s <i lang=

<p>Mr. Probert Evans having kindly given me the address of an aged
farmer who formerly lived in the valley, my friend, Mr. &#7930;ywarch
Reynolds, was good enough to visit him. Mr. Reynolds shall report the
result in his own words, dated January 9, 1899, as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was at Pentyrch this morning, and went to see Mr. David
Evans, formerly of Cefn Colston.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The old man is a very fine specimen of the better class of
Welsh farmer; is in his eighty-third year; hale and hearty,
intelligent, and in full possession of his faculties. He was born and
bred in the Rhon&#273;a Fechan Valley, and lived there until some forty
years ago. He had often heard the lake story from an old aunt of his
who lived at the Maerdy Farm (a short distance north of the lake), and
who died a good many years ago, at a very advanced age. He calls the
lake &ldquo;&#7930;yn Elferch,&rdquo; and the story, as known to him,
has several points in common with the &#7930;yn y Fan legend, which,
however, he did not appear to know. He could not give me many details,
but the following is the substance of the story as he knows
it:&mdash;The young farmer, who lived with his mother at the
neighbouring farm, one day saw the lady on the bank of the lake,
combing her hair, which reached down to her feet. He fell in love at
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href="#pb28" name=
"pb28">28</a>]</span>first sight, and tried to approach her; but she
evaded him, and crying out, <i lang="cy">&#272;ali di &#273;im o fi,
cr&acirc;s dy fara!</i> (Thou wilt not catch me, thou of the crimped
bread), she sank into the water. He saw her on several subsequent
occasions, and gave chase, but always with the same result, until at
length he got his mother to make him some bread which was not baked (or
not baked so hard); and this he offered to the lady. She then agreed to
become his wife, subject to the condition that if he offended her, or
disagreed with her three times (<i lang="cy">ar yr ammod, os byssa fa
yn &rsquo;i chroesi hi dair gwaith</i>) she would leave him and return
into the lake with all her belongings.</p>
<p>&lsquo;1. The first disagreement (<i lang="cy">croes</i>) was at the
funeral of a neighbour, a man in years, at which the lady gave way to
excessive weeping and lamentation. The husband expressed surprise and
annoyance at this excessive grief for the death of a person not related
to them, and asked the reason for it; and she replied that she grieved
for the defunct on account of the eternal misery that was in store for
him in the other world.</p>
<p>&lsquo;2. The second &ldquo;<i lang="cy">croes</i>&rdquo; was at the
death of an infant child of the lady herself, at which she laughed
immoderately; and in reply to the husband&rsquo;s remonstrance, she
said she did so for joy at her child&rsquo;s escape from this wicked
world and its passage into a world of bliss.</p>
<p>&lsquo;3. The third &ldquo;<i lang="cy">croes</i>&rdquo; Mr. Evans
was unable to call to mind, but equally with the other two it showed
that the lady was possessed of preternatural knowledge; and it resulted
in her leaving her husband and returning into the lake, taking the
cattle, &amp;c., with her. The accepted explanation of the name of the
lake was <i lang="cy">&#7930;yn El-ferch</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e6290src" href="#xd25e6290" name="xd25e6290src">13</a> (= Hela
&rsquo;r ferch), &ldquo;because of the young man <i>chasing the
damsel</i>&rdquo; (<i lang="cy">hela &rsquo;r ferch</i>). <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href="#pb29" name="pb29">29</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;The following is the cattle-call, as given to me by Mr.
Evans&rsquo; aged housekeeper, who migrated with the family from
Rhon&#273;a Fechan to Pentyrch:</p>
<div lang="cy" class="lgouter">

<p class="line"><i>Draw yn yr ithin [= eithin],</i></p>
<p class="line"><i>Dewch i gyd i lys y brenin.</i></p>
</div>
<p class="first">&lsquo;Mr. Evans told me that <i lang="cy">Dyffryn
Safrwch</i> was considered to be a corruption of <i lang="cy">Dyffryn
Safn yr Hwch</i>, &ldquo;Valley of the Sow&rsquo;s Mouth&rdquo;; so
that the explanation was not due to a minister with whom I foregathered
on my tramp near the lake the other day, and from whom I heard it
first.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The similarity between Mr. Evans&rsquo; version of this legend and
that of &#7930;yn y Fan Fach, tends to add emphasis to certain points
which I had been inclined to treat as merely accidental. In the Fan
Fach legend the young man&rsquo;s mother is a widow, and here he is
represented living with his mother. Here also something <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href="#pb30" name="pb30">30</a>]</span>depends
on the young man&rsquo;s bread, but it is abruptly introduced,
suggesting that a part of the story has been forgotten. Both stories,
however, give one the impression that the bread of the fairies was
regarded as always imperfectly baked. In both stories the young
man&rsquo;s mother comes to his help with her advice. Mr. Evans&rsquo;
version ascribes supernatural knowledge to the fairy, though his
version fails to support it; and her moralizings read considerably
later than those which the Fan legend ascribes to the fairy wife. Some
of these points may be brought under the reader&rsquo;s notice later,
when he has been familiarized with more facts illustrative of the
belief in fairies.</p>

<p class="first">On returning from South Wales to Carnarvonshire in the
summer of 1881, I tried to discover similar legends connected with the
lakes of North Wales, beginning with Geiriony&#273;, the waters of
which form a stream emptying itself into the Conwy, near Trefriw, a
little below &#7930;anrwst. I only succeeded, however, in finding an
old man of the name of Pierce Williams, about seventy years of age, who
was very anxious to talk about &lsquo;Bony&rsquo;s&rsquo; wars, but not
about lake ladies. I was obliged, in trying to make him understand what
I wanted, to use the word <i lang="cy">morforwyn</i>, that is to say in
English, &lsquo;mermaid&rsquo;; he then told me, that in his younger
days he had heard people say that somebody had seen such beings in the
Trefriw river. But as my questions were leading ones, his evidence is
not worth much; however, I feel pretty sure that one who knew the
neighbourhood of Geiriony&#273; better would be able to find some
fragments of interesting legends still existing in that wild district.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href="#pb31" name=
"pb31">31</a>]</span></p>
<p>I was more successful at &#7930;anberis, though what I found, at
first, was not much; but it was genuine, and to the point. This is the
substance of it:&mdash;An old woman, called Si&acirc;n<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e6427src" href="#xd25e6427" name=
"xd25e6427src">15</a> Dafy&#273;, lived at Helfa Fawr, in the dingle
called Cwm Brwynog, along the left side of which you ascend as you go
to the top of Snowdon, from the village of lower &#7930;anberis, or
Coed y &#272;ol, as it is there called. She was a curious old person,
who made nice distinctions between the virtues of the respective waters
of the district: thus, no other would do for her to cure her of the
<i lang="cy">defaid gwy&#7931;tion</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e6463src" href="#xd25e6463" name="xd25e6463src">16</a>, or
cancerous warts, which she fancied that she had in her mouth, than that
of the spring of Tai Bach, near the lake called &#7930;yn Ffynnon y
Gwas, though she seldom found it out, when she was deceived by a
servant who cherished a convenient opinion of his own, that a drop from
a nearer spring would do just as well. Old Si&acirc;n has been dead
over thirty-five years, but I have it, on the testimony of two highly
trustworthy brothers, who are of her family, and now between sixty and
seventy years of age, that she used to relate to them how a shepherd,
once on a time, saw a fairy maiden (<i lang="cy">un o&rsquo;r Tylwyth
Teg</i>) on the surface of the tarn called &#7930;yn Du&rsquo;r
Ar&#273;u, and how, from bantering and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb32" href="#pb32" name="pb32">32</a>]</span>joking, their
acquaintance ripened into courtship, when the father and mother of the
lake maiden appeared to give the union their sanction, and to arrange
the marriage settlement. This was to the effect that the husband was
never to strike his wife with iron, and that she was to bring her great
wealth with her, consisting of stock of all kinds for his mountain
farm. All duly took place, and they lived happily together until one
day, when trying to catch a pony, the husband threw a bridle to his
wife, and the iron in that struck her. It was then all over with him,
as the wife hurried away with her property into the lake, so that
nothing more was seen or heard of her. Here I may as well explain that
the &#7930;anberis side of the steep, near the top of Snowdon, is
called Clogwyn du&rsquo;r Ar&#273;u, or the Black Cliff of the
Ar&#273;u, at the bottom of which lies the tarn alluded to as the Black
Lake of the Ar&#273;u, and near it stands a huge boulder, called Maen
du&rsquo;r Ar&#273;u, all of which names are curious, as involving the
word <i lang="cy">du</i>, black. Ar&#273;u itself has much the same
meaning, and refers to the whole precipitous side of the summit with
its dark shadows, and there is a similar Ar&#273;u near Nanmor on the
Merionethshire side of Be&#273;gelert.</p>
<p>One of the brothers, I ought to have said, doubts that the lake here
mentioned was the one in old Si&acirc;n&rsquo;s tale; but he has
forgotten which it was of the many in the neighbourhood. Both, however,
remembered another short story about fairies, which they had heard
another old woman relate, namely, Mari Domos Si&ocirc;n, who died some
thirty years ago: it was merely to the effect that a shepherd had once
lost his way in the mist on the mountain on the land of Caeau Gwynion,
towards Cwe&#7931;yn<a class="noteref" id="xd25e6491src" href=
"#xd25e6491" name="xd25e6491src">17</a> Lake, and got into a ring
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb33" href="#pb33" name=
"pb33">33</a>]</span>where the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth Teg</i> were
dancing: it was only after a very hard struggle that he was able, at
length, to get away from them.</p>
<p>To this I may add the testimony of a lady, for whose veracity I can
vouch, to the effect that, when she was a child in Cwm Brwynog, from
thirty to forty years ago, she and her brothers and sisters used to be
frequently warned by their mother not to go far away from the house
when there happened to be thick mist on the ground, lest they should
come across the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth Teg</i> dancing, and be carried
away to their abode beneath the lake. They were always, she says,
supposed to live in the lakes; and the one here alluded to was
&#7930;yn Dwythwch, which is one of those famous for its <i lang=
"cy">torgochiaid</i> or chars. The mother is still living; but she
seems to have long since, like others, lost her belief in the
fairies.</p>
<p>After writing the above, I heard that a brother to the foregoing
brothers, namely, Mr. Thomas Davies, of Mur Mawr, &#7930;anberis,
remembered a similar tale. Mr. Davies is now sixty-four, and the
persons from whom he heard the tale were the same Si&acirc;n Dafy&#273;
of Helfa Fawr, and Mari Domos Si&ocirc;n of Tyn<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e6515src" href="#xd25e6515" name="xd25e6515src">18</a> Gadlas,
&#7930;anberis: the two women were about seventy years of age when he
as a child heard it from them. At my request, a friend of mine, Mr.

<p>&lsquo;To the farm of Bron y Fedw there belonged a son, who grew up
to be a young man, the women knew not how long before their time. He
was in the habit of going up the mountain to Cwm Dryweny&#273;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e6567src" href="#xd25e6567" name=
"xd25e6567src">19</a> and Myny&#273; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb35" href="#pb35" name="pb35">35</a>]</span>y Fedw, on the west side
of Snowdon, to do the shepherding, and there he was wont to come across
a lass on the mountain, so that as the result of frequently meeting one
another, he and she became great friends. They usually met at a
particular spot in Cwm Dryweny&#273;, where the girl and her family
lived, and where there were all kinds of nice things to eat, of
amusements, and of incomparable music; but he did not make up to
anybody there except the girl. The friendship ended in courtship; but
when the boy mentioned that she should be married to him, she would
only do so on one condition, namely, that she would live with him until
he should strike her with iron. They were wedded, and they lived
together for a number of years, and had children. Once on a time it
happened to be market day at Carnarvon, whither the husband and wife
thought of riding on ponies, like all the farmers of that time. So they
went to the mountain to catch a pony each. At the bottom of Myny&#273;
y Fedw there is a pool some sixty or one hundred yards long by twenty
or thirty broad, and on one side of it there is a level space along
which the horses used to run. The husband caught a pony, and gave it to
the wife to hold fast without a bridle, while he should catch another.
When he had bridled his own pony, he threw another bridle to his wife
for her to secure hers; but as he threw it, the bit of the bridle
struck her on one of her hands. The wife let go the pony, and went
headlong into the pool, and that was the end of their wedded
life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The following is a later tale, which Mr. Thomas Davies heard from
his mother, who died in 1832: she would be ninety years of age had she
been still living:&mdash;</p>
<p lang="cy"><i>Pan oe&#273; hi&rsquo;n hogan yn yr Hafod,
&#7930;anberis, yr oe&#273; hogan at ei hoed hi&rsquo;n cael ei magu yn
Cwmglas, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href="#pb36" name=
"pb36">36</a>]</span>&#7930;anberis, ac arferai &#273;weyd, pan yn
hogan a thra y bu byw, y by&#273;ai yn cael arian gan y Tylwyth Teg yn
Cwm Cwmglas.</i></p>
<p lang="cy"><i>Yr oe&#273; yn dweyd y by&#273;ai ar foreuau niwliog,
tywy&#7931;, yn mynd i le penodol yn Cwm Cwmglas gyda dsygiad o lefrith
o&rsquo;r fuches a thywel glan, ac yn ei ro&#273;i ar garreg; ac yn
mynd yno drachefn, ac yn cael y &#7931;estr yn wag, gyda darn
deusw&#7931;t neu hanner coron ac weithiau fwy wrth ei ochr.</i></p>
<p>&lsquo;When she was a girl, living at Yr Hafod, &#7930;anberis,
there was a girl of her age being brought up at Cwmglas in the same
parish. The latter was in the habit of saying, when she was a girl and
so long as she lived, that she used to have money from the <i lang=
"cy">Tylwyth Teg</i>, in the Cwmglas Hollow. Her account was, that on
dark, misty mornings she used to go to a particular spot in that Hollow
with a jugful of sweet milk from the milking place, and a clean towel,
and then place them on a stone. She would return, and find the jug
empty, with a piece of money placed by its side: that is, two shillings
or half a crown, or at times even more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A daughter of that woman lives now at a farm, Mr. Davies observes,
called Plas Pennant, in the parish of &#7930;anfihangel yn Mhennant, in
Carnarvonshire; and he adds, that it was a tale of a kind that was
common enough when he was a boy; but many laughed at it, though the old
people believed it to be a fact. To this I may as well append another
tale, which was brought to the memory of an old man who happened to be
present when Mr. Jones and Mr. Davies were busy with the foregoing. His
name is John Roberts, and his age is seventy-five: his present home is
at Capel S&iuml;on, in the neighbouring parish of
&#7930;an&#273;einiolen:&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;When a lad, he was a servant at Towyn Trewern, near Holyhead,
to an old man about his own age at present. They were one day in an old
building on the farm, and the old man told him that he had had much
money in that place when he was a lad, and that he would have had more
had it not been for his father. He had hidden the money at home, where
his mother found it and told his father of the affair: she feared he
was a bad boy, and that it was by theft he got it. His father said that
he would make him say where he got it, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb38" href="#pb38" name="pb38">38</a>]</span>or else that he would
strip him of the skin of his back, at the same time that he went out
and cut a rod fit for effecting a purpose of the kind. The boy heard
all this talk between his father and his mother, and felt determined to
keep the matter a secret, as he had been warned by the <i lang=
"cy">Tylwyth Teg</i>. He went into the house, and his father began to
question him, while he refused to answer. He supplicatingly protested
that the money was honestly got, and that he should get more if he kept
it a secret, but that, if he did not, there would be no more to be got.
However, the father would give no ear to his excuses or his reasons,
and the rod prevailed; so that the boy said that it was from the
<i lang="cy">Tylwyth Teg</i> he used to get it, and that on condition
of his not telling anybody. Greatly did the old folks regret having
killed the goose that laid the eggs. The boy went many a time
afterwards to the old building, but he never found any more money
there.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="first">Through the Rev. Daniel Lewis, incumbent of Bettws

of that place, who has kindly given me the result of his inquiries when
writing on the subject of the antiquities of the neighbourhood for a
competition at a literary meeting held there a few years ago. He tells
me that he got the following short tale from a native of Drws y Coed,
whose name is Margaret Williams. She has been living at Bettws Garmon
for many years, and is now over eighty. He does not know whether the
story is in print or not, but he is certain that Margaret Williams
never saw it, even if it be. He further thinks he has heard it from
another person, to wit a man over seventy-seven years <span class=

<p>&lsquo;The story goes, that the son of a farmer, who lived at the
Ystrad in Bettws Garmon, when returning home from a journey, late in
the evening, beheld a company of fairies in the middle of their mirth
and jollity. The youth was at once bewildered by the incomparable
beauty of one of these ladies, so that he ventured to leap into the
circle and take his idol away with him. After she had tarried awhile
with him at his home, he prevailed on her, on special conditions, to
become his wife. One of these conditions was that he should not touch
her with iron of any description. She became <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb40" href="#pb40" name="pb40">40</a>]</span>his
wife, and two children were born to them. One day the husband was in
the field trying to catch the horse; seeing him unsuccessful, the wife
went to him to help him, and, when the horse was galloping past him, he
let go the bridle at him in order to prevent him from passing; but whom
should he strike but his wife, who vanished out of his sight on the
spot.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Just as I was engaged in collecting these stories in 1881, a
correspondent sent me a copy of the Ystrad tale as published by the
late bard and antiquary, the Rev. Owen Wyn Jones, better known in Wales
by his bardic name of Glasynys<a class="noteref" id="xd25e6682src"
href="#xd25e6682" name="xd25e6682src">22</a>, in the <i lang=
"cy">Brython</i><a class="noteref" id="xd25e6690src" href="#xd25e6690"
name="xd25e6690src">23</a> for 1863, p. 193. I will not attempt to
translate Glasynys&rsquo; poetic prose with all its compound
adjectives, but it comes to this in a few words. One fine sunny
morning, as the young heir of Ystrad was busied with his sheep on the
side of Moel Eilio, he met a very pretty girl, and when he got home he
told the folks there of it. A few days afterwards he met her again, and
this happened several times, when he mentioned it to his father, who
advised <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb41" href="#pb41" name=
"pb41">41</a>]</span>him to seize her when he next met her. The next
time he met her he proceeded to do so, but before he could take her
away, a little fat old man came to them and begged him to give her back
to him, to which the youth would not listen. The little man uttered
terrible threats, but the heir of Ystrad would not yield, so an
agreement was made between them, that the latter was to have the girl
to wife until he touched her skin with iron, and great was the joy both
of the son and his parents in consequence. They lived together for many
years; but once on a time, on the evening of the Bettws Fair, the
wife&rsquo;s horse became restive, and somehow, as the husband was
attending to the horse, the stirrup touched the skin of her bare leg,
and that very night she was taken away from him. She had three or four
children, and more than one of their descendants, as Glasynys
maintains, were known to him at the time he wrote in 1863. Glasynys
regards this as the same tale which is given by Williams of
&#7930;andegai, to whom we shall refer later; and he says that he heard
it scores of times when he was a lad.</p>
<p>Lastly, I happened to mention these legends last summer among others
to the Rev. Owen Davies, curate of &#7930;anberis, a man who is well
versed in Welsh literature, and thoroughly in sympathy with everything
Welsh. Mr. Davies told me that he knew a tale of the sort from his
youth, as current in the parishes of &#7930;an&#7931;echid and
&#7930;andegai, near Bangor. Not long afterwards he visited his mother
at his native place, in &#7930;an&#7931;echid, in order to have his
memory of it refreshed; and he also went to the Waen Fawr, on the other
side of Carnarvon, where he had the same legend told him with the
different localities specified. The following is the Waen Fawr version,
of which I give the Welsh as I have had it from Mr. Davies, and as it
was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href="#pb42" name=
"pb42">42</a>]</span>related, according to him, some forty years ago in
the valley of Nant y Bettws, near Carnarvon:&mdash;</p>

<p>For the sake of an occasional reader who does not know Welsh, I add
a summary of it in English.</p>
<p>One fine evening in the month of June a brave, adventurous youth,
the heir of Ystrad, went to the banks of the Gwyrfai, not far from
where it leaves Cwe&#7931;yn Lake, and hid himself in the bushes near
the spot where the folks of the Red Coats&mdash;the fairies&mdash;were
wont to dance. The moon shone forth brightly without a cloud to
intercept her light; all was quiet save where the Gwyrfai gently
murmured on her bed, and it was not long before the young man had the
satisfaction of seeing the fair family dancing in full swing. As he
gazed on the subtle course of the dance, his eyes rested on a damsel,
the most shapely and beautiful he had seen from his boyhood. Her agile
movements and the charm of her looks inflamed him with love for her, to
such a degree that he felt ready for any encounter in order to secure
her to be his own. From his hiding place he watched every move for his
opportunity; at last, with feelings of anxiety and dread, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb45" href="#pb45" name="pb45">45</a>]</span>he
leaped suddenly into the middle of the circle of the fairies. There,
while their enjoyment of the dance was at its height, he seized her in
his arms and carried her away to his home at Ystrad. But, as she
screamed for help to free her from the grasp of him who had fallen in
love with her, the dancing party disappeared like one&rsquo;s breath in
July. He treated her with the utmost kindness, and was ever anxious to
keep her within his sight and in his possession. By dint of tenderness
he succeeded so far as to get her to consent to be his servant at
Ystrad. And such a servant she turned out to be! Why, she was wont to
milk the cows thrice a day, and to have the usual quantity of milk each
time, so that the butter was so plentiful that nobody thought of
weighing it. As to her name, in spite of all his endeavours to
ascertain it, she would never tell it him. Accidentally, however, one
moonlight night, when driving two of his cows to the spot where they
should graze, he came to the place where the fairies were wont to enjoy
their games in the light of the moon. This time also he hid himself in
a thicket, when he overheard one fairy saying to another, &lsquo;When
we were last here our sister Penelope was stolen from us by a
man.&rsquo; As soon as he heard this off he went home, full of joy
because he had discovered the name of the maid that was so dear to him.
She, on the other hand, was greatly astonished to hear him call her by
her own name. As she was so charmingly pretty, so industrious, so
skilled in every work, and so attended by luck in everything she put
her hand to, he offered to make her his wife instead of being his
servant. At first she would in no wise consent, but she rather gave way
to grief at his having found her name out. However, his importunity at
length brought her to consent, but on the condition that he should not
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href="#pb46" name=
"pb46">46</a>]</span>strike her with iron; if that should happen, she
would quit him never to return. The agreement was made on his side with
the readiness of love, and after this they lived in happiness and
comfort together for many years, and there were born to them a son and
a daughter, who were the handsomest children in the whole country.
Owing, also, to the skill and good qualities of the woman, as a shrewd
and virtuous wife, they became very rich&mdash;richer, indeed, than
anybody else in the country around; for, besides the husband&rsquo;s
own inheritance of Ystrad, he held all the northern part of Nant y
Bettws, and all from there to the top of Snowdon, together with Cwm
Brwynog in the parish of &#7930;anberis. But one day, as bad luck would
have it, they went out together to catch a horse in the field, and, as
the animal was somewhat wild and untamed, they had no easy work before
them. In his rashness the man threw a bridle at him as he was rushing
past him, but alas! on whom should the bridle fall but on the wife! No
sooner had this happened than she disappeared, and nothing more was
ever seen of her. But one cold night, when there was a chilling wind
blowing from the north, she came near the window of his bedroom, and
told him in these words to take care of the children:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Lest my son should find it cold,</p>
<p class="line">Place on him his father&rsquo;s coat:</p>
<p class="line">Lest the fair one find it cold,</p>
<p class="line">Place on her my petticoat.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Then she withdrew, and nothing more was heard of
her.</p>
<p>In reply to some queries of mine, Mr. O. Davies tells me that
Penelope was pronounced in three syllables,
P&eacute;n&#277;l&ocirc;p&mdash;so he heard it from his grandfather: he
goes on to say that the offspring of the Lake Lady is supposed to be
represented by a family called <i>Pellings</i>, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb47" href="#pb47" name="pb47">47</a>]</span>which
was once a highly respected name in those parts, and that there was a
Lady Bulkeley who was of this descent, not to mention that several
people of a lower rank, both in Anglesey and Arfon, claimed to be of
the same origin. I am not very clear as to how the name got into this
tale, nor have I been able to learn anything about the Pellings; but,
as the word appears to have been regarded as a corrupt derivative from
Penelope, that is, perhaps, all the connexion, so that it may be that
it has really nothing whatever to do with the legend. This is a point,
however, which the antiquaries of North Wales ought to be able to clear
up satisfactorily.</p>
<p>In reply to queries of mine, Mr. O. Davies gave me the following
particulars:&mdash;&lsquo;I am now (June, 1881) over fifty-two years of
age, and I can assure you that I have heard the legend forty years ago.
I do not remember my father, as he died when I was young, but my
grandfather was remarkable for his delight in tales and legends, and it
was his favourite pastime during the winter nights, after getting his
short black pipe ready, to relate stories about struggles with robbers,
about bogies, and above all about the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth Teg</i>; for
they were his chief delight. He has been dead twenty-six years, and he
had almost reached eighty years of age. His father before him, who was
born about the year 1740, was also famous for his stories, and my
grandfather often mentioned him as his authority in the course of his
narration of the tales. Both he and the rest of the family used to look
at Corwrion, to be mentioned presently, as a sacred spot. When I was a
lad and happened to be reluctant to leave off playing at dusk, my
mother or grandfather had only to say that &lsquo;the Pellings were
coming,&rsquo; in order to induce me to come into the house at once:
indeed, this announcement had <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href=
"#pb48" name="pb48">48</a>]</span>the same effect on persons of a much
riper age than mine then was.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Further, Mr. Davies kindly called my attention to a volume, entitled
<i>Observations on the Snowdon Mountains</i>, by Mr. William Williams,
of &#7930;andegai, published in London in 1802. In that work this tale
is given somewhat less fully than by Mr. Davies&rsquo; informant, but
the author makes the following remarks with regard to it, pp. 37,
40:&mdash;&lsquo;A race of people inhabiting the districts about the
foot of Snowdon, were formerly distinguished and known by the nickname
of <i>Pellings</i>, which is not yet extinct. There are several persons
and even families who are reputed to be descended from these
people&#8202;&hellip;. These children [Penelope&rsquo;s] and their
descendants, they say, were called <i>Pellings</i>, a word corrupted
from their mother&rsquo;s name, Penelope. The late Thomas Rowlands,
Esq., of Caerau, in Anglesey, the father of the late Lady Bulkeley, was
a descendant of this lady, if it be true that the name <i>Pellings</i>
came from her; and there are still living several opulent and
respectable people who are known to have sprung from the
<i>Pellings</i>. The best blood in my own veins is this
fairy&rsquo;s.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lastly, it will be noticed that these last versions do not
distinctly suggest that the Lake Lady ran into the lake, that is into
Cwe&#7931;yn, but rather that she disappeared in the same way as the
dancing party by simply becoming invisible like one&rsquo;s breath in
July. The fairies are called in Welsh, <i lang="cy">Y Tylwyth Teg</i>,
or the Fair Family; but the people of Arfon have been so familiarized
with the particular one I have called the Lake Lady, that, according to
one of my informants, they have invented the term <i lang="cy">Y
Dylwythes Deg</i>, or even <i lang="cy">Y Dylwythen Deg</i>, to denote
her; but it is unknown to the others, so that the extent of its use is
not very considerable. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href="#pb49"
name="pb49">49</a>]</span></p>
<p>This is, perhaps, the place to give another tale, according to which
the man goes to the Lake Maiden&rsquo;s country, instead of her
settling with him at his home. I owe it to the kindness of Mr. William
Jones, of Regent Place, &#7930;ango&#7931;en, a native of
Be&#273;gelert. He heard it from an old man before he left
Be&#273;gelert, but when he sent a friend to inquire some time
afterwards, the old man was gone. According to Mr. Jones, the details
of the tale are, for that reason, imperfect, as some of the incidents
have faded from his memory; but such as he can still remember the tale,
it is here given in his own words:&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;One bright moonlight night, as one of the sons of the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb50" href="#pb50" name=
"pb50">50</a>]</span>farmer who lived at &#7930;wyn On in Nant y Bettws
was going to pay his addresses to a girl at Clogwyn y Gwin, he beheld
the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth Teg</i> enjoying themselves in full swing on a
meadow close to Cwe&#7931;yn Lake. He approached them, and little by
little he was led on by the enchanting sweetness of their music and the
liveliness of their playing until he had got within their circle. Soon
some kind of spell passed over him, so that he lost his knowledge of
the place, and found himself in a country, the most beautiful he had
ever seen, where everybody spent his time in mirth and rejoicing. He
had been there seven years, and yet it seemed to him but a
night&rsquo;s dream; but a faint recollection came to his mind of the
business on which he had left home, and he felt a longing to see his
beloved one. So he went and asked for permission to return home, which
was granted him, together with a host of attendants to lead him to his
country; and, suddenly, he found himself, as if waking from a dream, on
the bank where he had seen the fair family amusing themselves. He
turned towards home, but there he found everything changed: his parents
were dead, his brothers could not recognize him, and his sweetheart was
married to another man. In consequence of such changes he died
broken-hearted in less than a week after coming back.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="first">The Rev. O. Davies regarded the &#7930;an&#7931;echid
legend as so very like the one he got about Cwe&#7931;yn Lake and the
Waen Fawr, that he has not written the former out at length, but merely
pointed out the following differences: (1) Instead of Cwe&#7931;yn, the
lake in the former is the pool of Corwrion, in the parish of
&#7930;andegai, near Bangor. (2) What the Lake Lady was struck with was
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb51" href="#pb51" name=
"pb51">51</a>]</span>not a bridle, but an iron fetter: the word used is
<i lang="cy">&#7931;yfether</i>, which probably means a long fetter
connecting a fore-foot and a hind-foot of a horse together. In Arfon,
the word is applied also to a cord tying the two fore-feet together,
but in Cardiganshire this would be called a <i lang="cy">hual</i>, the
other word, there pronounced <i lang="cy">llowethir</i>, being confined
to the long fetter. In books, the word is written <i lang=
"cy">llywethair</i>, <i lang="cy">llefethair</i> and <i lang=
"cy">llyffethair</i> or <i lang="cy">llyffethar</i>, which is possibly
the pronunciation in parts of North Wales, especially Arfon. This is an
interesting word, as it is no other than the English term &lsquo;long
fetter,&rsquo; borrowed into Welsh; as, in fact, it was also into Irish
early enough to call for an article on it in Cormac&rsquo;s <i>Irish
Glossary</i>, where <i lang="ga">langfiter</i> is described as an
English word for a fetter between the fore and the hind legs: in
Anglo-Manx it is become <i lang="gv">lanketer</i>. (3) The field in
which they were trying to catch the horse is, in the
&#7930;an&#7931;echid version, specified as that called Maes Madog, at
the foot of the &#7930;efn. (4) When the fairy wife ran away, it was
headlong into the pool of Corwrion, calling after her all her milch
cows, and they followed her with the utmost readiness.</p>
<p>Before going on to mention bits of information I have received from
others about the &#7930;an&#7931;echid legend, I think it best here to
finish with the items given me by Mr. O. Davies, whom I cannot too
cordially thank for his readiness to answer my questions. Among other
things, he expresses himself to the following effect:&mdash; &lsquo;It
is to this day a tradition&mdash;and I have heard it a hundred
times&mdash;that the dairy of Corwrion excelled all other dairies in
those parts, that the milk was better and more plentiful, and that the
cheese and butter were better there than in all the country round, the
reason assigned being that the cattle on the farm of Corwrion had mixed
with the breed belonging to the fairy, who <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href="#pb52" name="pb52">52</a>]</span>had run
away after being struck with the iron fetter. However that may be, I
remember perfectly well the high terms of praise in which the cows of
Corwrion used to be spoken of as being remarkable for their milk and
the profit they yielded; and, when I was a boy, I used to hear people
talk of <i lang="cy">Tarw Penwyn Corwrion</i>, or &ldquo;the
White-headed Bull of Corwrion,&rdquo; as derived from the breed of
cattle which had formed the fairy maiden&rsquo;s dowry.&rsquo;</p>
<p>My next informant is Mr. Hugh Derfel Hughes, of Pendinas,
&#7930;andegai<a class="noteref" id="xd25e6869src" href="#xd25e6869"
name="xd25e6869src">24</a>, who has been kind enough to give me the
version, of which I here give the substance in English, premising that
Mr. Hughes says that he has lived about thirty-four years within a mile
of the pool and farm house called Corwrion, and that he has refreshed
his memory of the legend by questioning separately no less than three
old people, who had been bred and born at or near that spot. He is a
native of Merioneth, but has lived at &#7930;andegai for the last
thirty-seven years, his age now being sixty-six. I may add that Mr.
Hughes is a local antiquary of great industry and zeal; and that he
published a book on the antiquities of the district, under the title of
<i lang="cy">Hynafiaethau &#7930;andegai a &#7930;an&#7931;echid</i>,
that is &lsquo;the Antiquities of &#7930;andegai and
&#7930;an&#7931;echid&rsquo; (Bethesda, 1866); but it is out of print,
and I have had some trouble to procure a copy:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In old times, when the fairies showed themselves much oftener
to men than they do now, they made their home in the bottomless pool of
Corwrion, in Upper Ar&#7931;echwe&#273;, in that wild portion of
Gwyne&#273; called <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53"
name="pb53">53</a>]</span>Arfon. On fine mornings in the month of June
these diminutive and nimble folk might be seen in a regular line
vigorously engaged in mowing hay, with their cattle in herds busily
grazing in the fields near Corwrion. This was a sight which often met
the eyes of the people on the sides of the hills around, even on
Sundays; but when they hurried down to them they found the fields
empty, with the sham workmen and their cows gone, all gone. At other
times they might be heard hammering away like miners, shovelling
rubbish aside, or emptying their carts of stones. At times they took to
singing all the night long, greatly to the delight of the people about,
who dearly loved to hear them; and, besides singing so charmingly, they
sometimes formed into companies for dancing, and their movements were
marvellously graceful and attractive. But it was not safe to go too
near the lake late at night, for once a brave girl, who was troubled
with toothache, got up at midnight and went to the brink of the water
in search of the root of a plant that grows there full of the power to
kill all pain in the teeth. But, as she was plucking up a bit of it,
there burst on her ear, from the depths of the lake, such a shriek as
drove her back into the house breathless with fear and trembling; but
whether this was not the doing of a stray fairy, who had been
frightened out of her wits at being suddenly overtaken by a damsel in
her nightdress, or the ordinary fairy way of curing the toothache,
tradition does not tell. For sometimes, at any rate, the fairies busied
themselves in doing good to the men and women who were their
neighbours, as when they tried to teach them to keep all promises and
covenants to which they pledged themselves. A certain man and his wife,
to whom they wished to teach this good habit, have never been
forgotten. The husband had been behaving as <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb54" href="#pb54" name="pb54">54</a>]</span>he
ought, until one day, as he held the plough, with the wife guiding his
team, he broke his covenant towards her by treating her harshly and
unkindly. No sooner had he done so, than he was snatched through the
air and plunged in the lake. When the wife went to the brink of the
water to ask for him back, the reply she had was, that he was there,
and that there he should be.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The fairies when engaged in dancing allowed themselves to be
gazed at, a sight which was wont greatly to attract the young men of
the neighbourhood, and once on a time the son and heir of the owner of
Corwrion fell deeply in love with one of the graceful maidens who
danced in the fairy ring, for she was wondrously beautiful and pretty
beyond compare. His passion for her ere long resulted in courtship, and
soon in their being married, which took place on the express
understanding, that firstly the husband was not to know her name,
though he might give her any name he chose; and, secondly, that he
might now and then beat her with a rod, if she chanced to misbehave
towards him; but he was not to strike her with iron on pain of her
leaving him at once. This covenant was kept for some years, so that
they lived happily together and had four children, of whom the two
youngest were a boy and a girl. But one day as they went to one of the
fields of Bryn Twrw in the direction of Pennar&#273; Gron, to catch a
pony, the fairy wife, being so much nimbler than her husband, ran
before him and had her hand in the pony&rsquo;s mane in no time. She
called out to her husband to throw her a halter, but instead of that he
threw towards her a bridle with an iron bit, which, as bad luck would
have it, struck her. The wife at once flew through the air, and plunged
headlong into Corwrion Pool. The husband returned <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href="#pb55" name="pb55">55</a>]</span>sighing
and weeping towards Bryn Twrw, &ldquo;Noise Hill,&rdquo; and when he
had reached it, the <i lang="cy">twrw</i>, &ldquo;noise,&rdquo; there
was greater than had ever been heard before, namely that of weeping
after &ldquo;Belen&euml;&rdquo;; and it was then, after he had struck
her with iron, that he first learnt what his wife&rsquo;s name was.
Belen&euml; never came back to her husband, but the feelings of a
mother once brought her to the window of his bedroom, where she gave
him the following order:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div lang="cy" class="lg">
<p class="line"><i>Os by&#273; anwyd ar fy mab,</i></p>

<p class="line">If the fair one feel the cold,</p>
<p class="line">Let her wear my petticoat.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">&lsquo;As years and years rolled on a grandson of
Belen&euml;&rsquo;s fell in love with a beautiful damsel who lived at a
neighbouring farm house called Tai Teulwriaid, and against the will of
his father and mother they married, but they had nothing to stock their
land with. So one morning what was their astonishment, when they got
up, to see grazing quietly in the field six black cows and a
white-headed bull, which had come up out of the lake as stock for them
from old grannie Belen&euml;? They served them well with milk and
butter for many a long year, but on the day the last of the family
died, the six black cows and the white-headed bull disappeared into the
lake, never more to be seen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hughes referred to no less than three other versions, as
follows:&mdash;(1) According to one account, the husband was ploughing,
with the wife leading the team, when by chance he came across her and
the accident happened. The wife then flew away like a wood-hen
(<i lang="cy">iar goed</i>) into the lake. (2) Another says that they
were in a stable trying to bridle one of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb56" href="#pb56" name="pb56">56</a>]</span>horses,
when the misfortune took place through inadvertence. (3) A third
specifies the field in front of the house at Corwrion as the place
where the final accident took place, when they were busied with the
cows and horses.</p>
<p>To these I would add the following traditions, which Mr. Hughes
further gives. Sometimes the inhabitants, who seem to have been on the
whole on good terms with the fairies, used to heat water and leave it
in a vessel on the hearth overnight for the fairies to wash their
children in it. This they considered such a kindness that they always
left behind them on the hearth a handful of their money. Some pieces
are said to have been sometimes found in the fields near Corwrion, and
that they consisted of coins which were smaller than our halfpennies,
but bigger than farthings, and had a harp on one side. But the
tradition is not very definite on these points.</p>
<p>Here also I may as well refer to a similar tale which I got last
year at &#7930;anberis from a man who is a native of the
&#7930;an&#7931;echid side of the mountain, though he now lives at
&#7930;anberis. He is about fifty-five years of age, and remembers
hearing in his youth a tale connected with a house called
Hafoty&rsquo;r Famaeth, in a very lonely situation on
&#7930;an&#7931;echid Mountain, and now represented only by some old
ruined walls. It was to the effect that one night, when the man who
lived there was away from home, his wife, who had a youngish baby,
washed him on the hearth, left the water there, and went to bed with
her little one: she woke up in the night to find that the <i lang=
"cy">Tylwyth Teg</i> were in possession of the hearth, and busily
engaged in washing their children. That is all I got of this tale of a
well-known type.</p>
<p>To return to Mr. Hughes&rsquo; communications, I would select from
them some remarks on the topography of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb57" href="#pb57" name="pb57">57</a>]</span>the teeming home of the
fairies. He estimated the lake or pool of Corwrion to be about 120
yards long, and adds that it is nearly round; but he thinks it was
formerly considerably larger, as a cutting was made some eighty or a
hundred years ago to lead water from it to Penrhyn Castle; but even
then its size would not approach that ascribed to it by popular belief,
according to which it was no less than three miles long. In fact it was
believed that there was once a town of Corwrion which was swallowed up
by the lake, a sort of idea which one meets with in many parts of
Wales, and some of the natives are said to be able to discern the
houses under the water. This must have been near the end which is not
bottomless, the latter being indicated by a spot which is said never to
freeze even in hard winters. Old men remember it the resort of herons,
cormorants, and the water-hen (<i lang="cy">hobi wen</i>). Near the
banks there grew, besides the water-lily, various kinds of rushes and
sedges, which were formerly much used for making mats and other useful
articles. It was also once famous for eels of a large size, but it is
not supposed to have contained fish until Lord Penrhyn placed some
there in recent years. It teemed, however, with leeches of three
different kinds so recently that an old man still living describes to
Mr. Hughes his simple way of catching them when he was a boy, namely,
by walking bare-legged in the water: in a few minutes he landed with
nine or ten leeches sticking to his legs, some of which fetched a
shilling each from the medical men of those days. Corwrion is now a
farm house occupied by Mr. William Griffiths, a grandson of the late
bard Gutyn Peris. When Mr. Hughes called to make inquiries about the
legend, he found there the foundations of several old buildings, and
several pieces of old querns about the place. He <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb58" href="#pb58" name="pb58">58</a>]</span>thinks
that there belonged to Corwrion in former times, a mill and a
fuller&rsquo;s house, which he seems to infer from the names of two
neighbouring houses called &lsquo;Y Felin Hen,&rsquo; the Old Mill, and
&lsquo;Pandy Tre Garth,&rsquo; the Fulling Mill of Tregarth,
respectively. He also alludes to a <i lang="cy">gefail</i> or smithy
there, in which one Rhys ab Robert used to work, not to mention that a
great quantity of ashes, such as come from a smithy, are found at the
end of the lake furthest from the farm house. The spot on which
Corwrion stands is part of the ground between the Ogwen and another
stream which bears the name of &lsquo;Afon Cegin Arthur,&rsquo; or the
River of Arthur&rsquo;s Kitchen, and most of the houses and fields
about have names which have suggested various notions to the people
there: such are the farms called &lsquo;Coed Howel,&rsquo; whence the
belief in the neighbourhood that Howel &#272;a, King of Wales, lived
here. About him Mr. Hughes has a great deal to say: among other things,
that he had boats on Corwrion lake, and that he was wont to present the
citizens of Bangor yearly with 300 fat geese reared on the waters of
the same. I am referred by another man to a lecture delivered in the
neighbourhood on these and similar things by the late bard and
antiquary the Rev. Robert Ellis (Cyn&#273;elw), but I have never come
across a copy. A field near Corwrion is called &lsquo;Cae
Stabal,&rsquo; or the Field of the Stable, which contains the remains
of a row of stables, as it is supposed, and of a number of mangers
where Howel&rsquo;s horses were once fed. In a neighbouring wood,
called &lsquo;Parc y Ge&#7931;i&rsquo; or &lsquo;Hopiar y
Ge&#7931;i,&rsquo; my informant goes on to say, there are to be seen
the foundations of seventeen or eighteen old hut-circles, and near them
some think they see the site of an old church. About a mile to the
south-east of Corwrion is Pendinas, which Mr. Hughes describes as
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href="#pb59" name=
"pb59">59</a>]</span>an old triangular Welsh fortress, on the bank of
the Ogwen; and within two stone&rsquo;s-throws or so of Corwrion on the
south side of it, and a little to the west of Bryn Twrw mentioned in
the legend, is situated Penar&#273; Gron, a <i lang="cy">caer</i> or
fort, which he describes as being, before it was razed in his time,
forty-two yards long by thirty-two wide, and defended by a sort of
rampart of earth and stone several yards wide at the base. It used to
be the resort of the country people for dancing, cock-fighting<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e6973src" href="#xd25e6973" name=
"xd25e6973src">26</a>, and other amusements on Sundays. Near it was a
cairn, which, when it was dug into, was found to cover a kistvaen, a
pot, and a quern: a variety of tales attaching to it are told
concerning ghosts, caves, and hidden treasures. Altogether Mr. Hughes
is strongly of opinion that Corwrion and its immediate surroundings
represent a spot which at one time had great importance; and I see no
reason wholly to doubt the correctness of that conclusion, but it would
be interesting to know whether Penrhyn used, as Mr. Hughes suggests, to
be called Penrhyn Corwrion; there ought, perhaps, to be no great
difficulty in ascertaining this, as some of the Penrhyn estate appears
to have been the subject of litigation in times gone by.</p>
<p>Before leaving Mr. Hughes&rsquo; notes, I must here give his too
brief account of another thing connected with Corwrion, though,
perhaps, not with the legends here in question. I allude to what he
calls the Lantern Ghost (<i lang="cy">Ysbryd y
Lantar</i>):&mdash;&lsquo;There used to be formerly,&rsquo; he says,
&lsquo;and there is still at Corwrion, a good-sized sour apple-tree,
which during the winter half of the year used to be lit up by fire. It
began slowly and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href="#pb60" name=
"pb60">60</a>]</span>grew greater until the whole seemed to be in a
blaze. He was told by an old woman that she formerly knew old people
who declared they had seen it. In the same way the trees in Hopiar y
Ge&#7931;i appeared, according to them, to be also lit up with
fire.&rsquo; This reminds me of Mr. Fitzgerald&rsquo;s account of the
Irish Bile-Tineadh in the <i lang="fr">Revue Celtique</i>, iv. 194.</p>
<p>After communicating to me the notes of which the foregoing are
abstracts, Mr. Hughes kindly got me a version of the legend from Mr.
David Thomas, of Pont y Wern, in the same neighbourhood, but as it
contains nothing which I have not already given from Mr. Hughes&rsquo;
own, I pass it by. Mr. Thomas, however, has heard that the number of
the houses making up the town of Corwrion some six or seven centuries
ago was about seventy-five; but they were exactly seventy-three
according to my next informant, Mr. David Evan Davies, of Treflys,
Bethesda, better known by his bardic name of Dewi Glan Ffrydlas. Both
these gentlemen have also heard the tradition that there was a church
at Corwrion, where there used to be every Sunday a single service,
after which the people went to a spot not far off to amuse themselves,
and at night to watch the fairies dancing, or to mix with them while
they danced in a ring around a glow-worm. According to Dewi Glan
Ffrydlas, the spot was the Pen y Bonc, already mentioned, which means,
among other things, that they chose a rising ground. This is referred
to in a modern rhyme, which runs thus:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div lang="cy" class="lg">
<p class="line"><i>A&rsquo;r Tylwyth Teg yn dawnsio&rsquo;n
sionc</i></p>
<p class="line"><i>O gylch mag&iuml;en Pen y Bonc.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">With the fairies nimbly dancing round</p>
<p class="line">The glow-worm on the Rising Ground.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">Dewi Glan Ffrydlas has kindly gone to the trouble of
giving me a brief, but complete, version of the legend as he has heard
it. It will be noticed that the discovering <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href="#pb61" name="pb61">61</a>]</span>of the
fairy&rsquo;s name is an idle incident in this version: it is brought
in too late, and no use is made of it when introduced. This is the
substance of his story in English:&mdash;&lsquo;At one of the dances at
Pen y Bonc, the heir of Corwrion&rsquo;s eyes fell on one of the
damsels of the fair family, and he was filled with love for her.
Courtship and marriage in <span class="corr" id="xd25e7007" title=
"Source: duetime">due time</span> ensued, but he had to agree to two
conditions, namely, that he was neither to know her name nor to strike
her with iron. By-and-by they had children, and when the husband
happened to go, during his wife&rsquo;s confinement, to a merry-making
at Pen y Bonc, the fairies talked together concerning his wife, and in
expressing their feelings of sympathy for her, they inadvertently
betrayed the mystery of her name by mentioning it within his hearing.
Years rolled on, when the husband and wife went out together one day to
catch a colt of theirs that had not been broken in, their object being
to go to Conway Fair. Now, as she was swifter of foot than her husband,
she got hold of the colt by the mane, and called out to him to throw
her a halter, but instead of throwing her the one she asked for, he
threw another with iron in it, which struck her. Off she went into the
lake. A grandson of this fairy many years afterwards married one of the
girls of Corwrion. They had a large piece of land, but no means of
stocking it, so that they felt rather distressed in their minds. But lo
and behold! one day a white-headed bull came out of the lake, bringing
with him six black cows to their land. There never were the like of
those cows for milk, and great was the prosperity of their owners, as
well as the envy it kindled in their neighbours&rsquo; breasts. But
when they both grew old and died, the bull and the cows went back into
the lake.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Now I add the other sayings about the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth Teg</i>,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb62" href="#pb62" name=
"pb62">62</a>]</span>which Dewi Glan Ffrydlas has kindly collected for
me, beginning with a blurred story about changelings:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Once on a time, in the fourteenth century, the wife of a man
at Corwrion had twins, and she complained one day to a witch, who lived
close by, at Ty&#273;yn y Barcud, that the children were not getting
on, but that they were always crying day and night. &ldquo;Are you sure
that they are your children?&rdquo; asked the witch, adding that it did
not seem to her that they were like hers. &ldquo;I have my doubts
also,&rdquo; said the mother. &ldquo;I wonder if somebody has exchanged
children with you,&rdquo; said the witch. &ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo;
said the mother. &ldquo;But why do you not seek to know?&rdquo; asked
the other. &ldquo;But how am I to go about it?&rdquo; said the mother.
The witch replied, &ldquo;Go and do something rather strange before
their eyes and watch what they will say to one another.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Well, I do not know what I should do,&rdquo; said the mother.
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;take an egg-shell, and
proceed to brew beer in it in a chamber aside, and come here to tell me
what the children will say about it.&rdquo; She went home and did as
the witch had directed her, when the two children lifted their heads
out of the cradle to find what she was doing&mdash;to watch and to
listen. Then one observed to the other, &ldquo;I remember seeing an oak
having an acorn,&rdquo; to which the other replied, &ldquo;And I
remember seeing a hen having an egg&rdquo;; and one of the two added,
&ldquo;But I do not remember before seeing anybody brew beer in the
shell of a hen&rsquo;s egg.&rdquo; The mother then went to the witch
and told her what the twins had said one to the other; and she directed
her to go to a small wooden bridge, not far off, with one of the
strange children under each arm, and there to drop them from the bridge
into the river beneath. The mother went back home again and did as she
had been directed. When she reached home <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb63" href="#pb63" name="pb63">63</a>]</span>this time, she found to
her astonishment that her own children had been brought
back.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Next comes a story about a midwife who lived at Corwrion. &lsquo;One
of the fairies called to ask her to come and attend on his wife. Off
she went with him, and she was astonished to be taken into a splendid
palace. There she continued to go night and morning to dress the baby
for some time, until one day the husband asked her to rub her eyes with
a certain ointment he offered her. She did so, and found herself
sitting on a tuft of rushes, and not in a palace. There was no baby:
all had disappeared. Some time afterwards she happened to go to the
town, and whom should she there see busily buying various wares, but
the fairy on whose wife she had been attending. She addressed him with
the question, &ldquo;How are you to-day?&rdquo; Instead of answering
her, he asked, &ldquo;How do you see me?&rdquo; &ldquo;With my
eyes,&rdquo; was the prompt reply. &ldquo;Which eye?&rdquo; he asked.
&ldquo;This one,&rdquo; said the woman, pointing to it; and instantly
he disappeared, never more to be seen by her.&rsquo; This tale, as will
be seen on comparison later, is incomplete, and probably incorrect.</p>
<p>Here is another from Mr. D. E. Davies:&mdash;&lsquo;One day Guto,
the farmer of Corwrion, complained to his wife that he lacked men to
mow his hay, when she replied, &ldquo;Why fret about it? look yonder!
There you have a field full of them at it, and stripped to their
shirt-sleeves (<i lang="cy">yn &#7931;ewys eu crysau</i>).&rdquo; When
he went to the spot the sham workmen of the fairy family had
disappeared. This same Guto&mdash;or somebody else&mdash;happened
another time to be ploughing, when he heard some person he could not
see, calling out to him, &ldquo;I have got the <i>bins</i> (that is the
<i>vice</i>) of my plough broken.&rdquo; &ldquo;Bring it to me,&rdquo;
said the driver of Guto&rsquo;s team, &ldquo;that I may mend it.&rdquo;
When they finished the furrow, they found the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb64" href="#pb64" name="pb64">64</a>]</span>broken
vice, with a barrel of beer placed near it. One of the men sat down and
mended the vice. Then they made another furrow, and when they returned
to the spot they found there a two-eared dish filled to the brim with
<i lang="cy">bara a chwrw</i>, or &ldquo;bread and beer.&rdquo; The
word <i>vice</i>, I may observe, is an English term, which is applied
in Carnarvonshire to a certain part of the plough: it is otherwise
called <i>bins</i>, but neither does this seem to be a Welsh word, nor
have I heard either used in South Wales.</p>
<p>At times one of the fairies was in the habit, as I was told by more
than one of my informants, of coming out of &#7930;yn Corwrion with her
spinning-wheel (<i lang="cy">troe&#7931; bach</i>) on fine summer days
and betaking herself to spinning. While at that work she might be heard
constantly singing or humming, in a sort of round tune, the words
<i lang="cy">s&igrave;li ffrit</i>. So that <i lang="cy">s&igrave;li
ffrit Leisa B&egrave;la</i> may now be heard from the mouths of the
children in that neighbourhood. But I have not been successful in
finding out what Liza Bella&rsquo;s &lsquo;silly frit&rsquo; exactly
means, though I am, on the whole, convinced that the words are other
than of Welsh origin. The last of them, <i lang="cy">ffrit</i>, is
usually applied in Cardiganshire to anything worthless or
insignificant, and the derivative, <i lang="cy">ffrityn</i>, means one
who has no go or perseverance in him: the feminine is <i lang=
"cy">ffriten</i>. In Carnarvonshire my wife has heard <i lang=
"cy">ffrityn</i> and <i lang="cy">ffritan</i> applied to a small man
and a small woman respectively. Mr. Hughes says that in Merioneth and
parts of Powys <i lang="cy">s&igrave;li ffrit</i> is a term applied to
a small woman or a female dwarf who happens to be proud, vain, and fond
of the attentions of the other sex (<i lang="cy">benyw fach neu
goraches falch a hunanol a fy&#273;ai hoff o garu</i>); but he thinks
he has heard it made use of with regard to the gipsies, and possibly
also to the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth Teg</i>. The Rev. O. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb65" href="#pb65" name="pb65">65</a>]</span>Davies
thinks the words <i lang="cy">s&igrave;li ffrit Leisa B&egrave;la</i>
to be very modern, and that they refer to a young woman who lived at a
place in the neighbourhood, called Bryn B&egrave;la or Brymb&egrave;la,
&lsquo;Bella&rsquo;s Hill,&rsquo; the point being that this Bella was
ahead, in her time, of all the girls in those parts in matters of taste
and fashion. This however does not seem to go far enough back, and it
is possible still that in <i lang="cy">B&egrave;la</i>, that is, in
English spelling, <i>Bella</i>, we have merely a shortening of some
such a name as Isabella or Arabella, which were once much more popular
in the Principality than they are now: in fact, I do not feel sure that
<i lang="cy">Leisa B&egrave;la</i> is not bodily a corruption of
<i>Isabella</i>. As to <i lang="cy">s&igrave;li ffrit</i>, one might at
first have been inclined to render it by small fry, especially in the
sense of the French &lsquo;<span lang="fr">de la friture</span>&rsquo;
as applied to young men and boys, and to connect it with the Welsh
<i lang="cy">sil</i> and <i lang="cy">silod</i>, which mean small fish;
but the pronunciation of <i lang="cy">silli</i> or <i lang=
"cy">s&igrave;li</i> being nearly that of the English word
<i>silly</i>, it appears, on the whole, to belong to the host of
English words to be found in colloquial Welsh, though they seldom find
their way into books. Students of English ought to be able to tell us
whether <i>frit</i> had the meaning here suggested in any part of
England, and how lately; also, whether there was such a phrase as
&lsquo;silly frit&rsquo; in use. After penning this, I received the
following interesting communication from Mr. William Jones, of
&#7930;ango&#7931;en:&mdash;The term <i lang="cy">s&igrave;li ffrit</i>
was formerly in use at Be&#273;gelert, and what was thereby meant was a
child of the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth Teg</i>. It is still used for any
creature that is smaller than ordinary. &lsquo;Pooh, a silly frit like
that!&rsquo; (<i lang="cy">Pw, rhyw s&igrave;li ffrit fel yna!</i>).
&lsquo;Mrs. So-and-So has a fine child.&rsquo; &lsquo;Ha, do you call a
silly frit like that a fine child?&rsquo; (<i lang="cy">Mae gan hon a
hon blentyn braf. Ho, a ydych chwi&rsquo;n galw rhyw s&igrave;li ffrit
fel hwnna&rsquo;n <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb66" href="#pb66"
name="pb66">66</a>]</span>braf?</i>) To return to Leisa B&egrave;la and
Belen&euml;, it may be that the same person was meant by both these
names, but I am in no hurry to identify them, as none of my
correspondents knows the latter of them except Mr. Hughes, who gives it
on the authority of the bard Gutyn Peris, and nothing further so far as
I can understand, whereas B&egrave;la will come before us in another
story, as it is the same name, I presume, which Glasynys has spelled
<i lang="cy">Bella</i> in <i lang="cy">Cymru Fu</i>.</p>
<p>So I wrote in 1881: since then I have ascertained from Professor
Joseph Wright, who is busily engaged on his great <i>English Dialect
Dictionary</i>, that <i>frit</i><a class="noteref" id="xd25e7154src"
href="#xd25e7154" name="xd25e7154src">27</a> is the same word, in the
dialects of Cheshire, Shropshire, and Pembrokeshire, as <i>fright</i>
in literary English; and that the corresponding verb to <i>frighten</i>
is in them <i>fritten</i>, while a <i>frittenin</i> (= the book English
<i>frightening</i>) means a ghost or apparition. So <i lang=
"cy">s&igrave;li ffrit</i> is simply the English <i>silly frit</i>, and
means probably a silly sprite or silly ghost, and <i lang=
"cy">s&igrave;li ffrit Leisa B&egrave;la</i> would mean the silly ghost
of a woman called Liza Bella. But the silly frit found spinning near
Corwrion Pool will come under notice again, for that fairy belongs to
the Rumpelstiltzchen group of tales, and the fragment of a story about
her will be seen to have treated Silly Frit as her proper name, which
she had not intended to reach the ears of the person of whom she was
trying to get the better.</p>
<p>These tales are brought into connexion with the present day in more
ways than one, for besides the various accounts of the <i lang=
"cy">bwganod</i> or bogies of Corwrion frightening people when out late
at night, Mr. D. E. Davies knows a man, who is still living, and who
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb67" href="#pb67" name=
"pb67">67</a>]</span>well remembers the time when the sound of working
used to be heard in the pool, and the voices of children crying
somewhere in its depths, but that when people rushed there to see what
the matter was, all was found profoundly quiet and still. Moreover,
there is a family or two, now numerously represented in the parishes of
&#7930;andegai and &#7930;an&#7931;echid, who used to be taunted with
being the offspring of fairy ancestors. One of these families was
nicknamed &lsquo;Simychiaid&rsquo; or &lsquo;Smychiaid&rsquo;; and my
informant, who is not yet quite forty, says that he heard his mother
repeat scores of times that the old people used to say, that the
Smychiaid, who were very numerous in the neighbourhood, were descended
from fairies, and that they came from &#7930;yn Corwrion. At all this
the Smychiaid were wont to grow mightily angry. Another tradition, he
says, about them was that they were a wandering family that arrived in
the district from the direction of Conway, and that the father&rsquo;s
name was a Simwch, or rather that was his nickname, based on the proper
name Simwnt, which appears to have once been the prevalent name in
&#7930;andegai. The historical order of these words would in that case
have been <i lang="cy">Simwnt</i>, <i lang="cy">Simwch</i>, <i lang=
"cy">Simychiaid</i>, <i lang="cy">Smychiaid</i>. Now <i lang=
"cy">Simwnt</i> seems to be merely the Welsh form given to some such
English name as <i>Simond</i>, just as <i>Edmund</i> or <i>Edmond</i>
becomes in North Wales <i lang="cy">Emwnt</i>. The objection to the
nickname seems to lie in the fact, which one of my correspondents
points out to me, that Simwch is understood to mean a monkey, a point
on which I should like to have further information. Pughe gives
<i lang="cy">simach</i>, it is true, as having the meaning of the Latin
<i lang="la">simia</i>. A branch of the same family is said to be
called &lsquo;y Cowperiaid&rsquo; or the Coopers, from an ancestor who
was either by name or by trade a cooper. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb68" href="#pb68" name="pb68">68</a>]</span>Mr. Hughes&rsquo; account
of the Smychiaid was, that they are the descendants of one Simonds, who
came to be a bailiff at Bodysga&#7931;an, near Deganwy, and moved from
there to Coetmor in the neighbourhood of Corwrion. Simonds was
obnoxious to the bards, he goes on to say, and they described the
Smychiaid as having arrived in the parish at the bottom of a <i lang=
"cy">cawe&#7931;</i>, &lsquo;a creel or basket carried on the
back,&rsquo; when chance would have it that the <i lang=
"cy">cawe&#7931;</i> cord snapped just in that neighbourhood, at a
place called Pont y &#7930;an. That accident is described, according to
Mr. Hughes, in the following doggerel, the origin of which I do not
know&mdash;</p>

<p class="first">Curiously enough, the same <i lang=
"cy">cawe&#7931;</i> story used to be said of a widely spread family in
North Cardiganshire, whose surname was pronounced Massn and written
Mason or Mazon: as my mother was of this family, I have often heard it.
The <i lang="cy">cawe&#7931;</i>, if I remember rightly, was said, in
this instance, to have come from Scotland, to which were traced three
men who settled in North Cardiganshire. One had no descendants, but the
other two, Mason and Peel&mdash;I think his name was Peel, but I am
only sure that it was not Welsh&mdash;had so many, that the Masons, at
any rate, are exceedingly numerous there; but a great many of them,
owing to some extent, probably, to the <i lang="cy">cawe&#7931;</i>
story, have been silly enough to change their name into that of Jones,
some of them in my time. The three men came there probably for refuge
in the course of troubles in Scotland, as a Frazer and a Francis did to
Anglesey. At any rate, I have never heard it suggested that they were
of aquatic origin, but, taking the <i lang="cy">cawe&#7931;</i> into
consideration, and the popular account of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb69" href="#pb69" name="pb69">69</a>]</span>the Smychiaid, I should
be inclined to think that the <i lang="cy">cawe&#7931;</i> originally
referred to some such a supposed descent. I only hope that somebody
will help us with another and a longer <i lang="cy">cawe&#7931;</i>
tale, which will make up for the brevity of these allusions. We may,
however, assume, I think, that there was a tendency at one time in
Gwyne&#273;, if not in other parts of the Principality, to believe, or
pretend to believe, that the descendants of an Englishman or Scotsman,
who settled among the old inhabitants, were of fairy origin, and that
their history was somehow uncanny, which was all, of course, duly
resented. This helps, to some extent, to explain how names of doubtful
origin have got into these tales, such as <i lang="cy">Smychiaid</i>,
<i lang="cy">Cowperiaid</i>, <i>Pellings</i>, <i>Penelope</i>, <i lang=
"cy">Leisa B&egrave;la</i> or <i>Isabella</i>, and the like. This
association of the lake legends with intruders from without is what
has, perhaps, in a great measure served to rescue such legends from
utter oblivion.</p>
<p>As to a church at Corwrion, the tradition does not seem to be an old
one, and it appears founded on one of the popular etymologies of the
word Corwrion, which treats the first syllable as <i lang="cy">cor</i>
in the sense of a choir; but the word has other meanings, including
among them that of an ox-stall or enclosure for cattle. Taking this as
coming near the true explanation, it at once suggests itself, that
Creuwyryon in the <i>Mabinogi</i> of Math ab Mathonwy is the same
place, for <i lang="cy">creu</i> or <i lang="cy">crau</i> also meant an
enclosure for animals, including swine. In Irish the word is <i lang=
"cy">cr&oacute;</i>, an enclosure, a hut or hovel. The passage in the
<i>Mabinogi</i><a class="noteref" id="xd25e7329src" href="#xd25e7329"
name="xd25e7329src">28</a> relates to Gwydion returning with the swine
he had got by dint of magic and deceit from Pryderi, prince of Dyfed,
and runs thus in Lady Charlotte Guest&rsquo;s translation: &lsquo;So
they journeyed on to the highest town of Ar&#7931;echwe&#273;,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb70" href="#pb70" name=
"pb70">70</a>]</span>and there they made a sty (<i lang="cy">creu</i>)
for the swine, and therefore was the name of Creuwyryon given to that
town.&rsquo; As to <i lang="cy">wyryon</i> or <i lang="cy">wyrion</i>,
which we find made into <i lang="cy">wrion</i> in Corwrion according to
the modern habit, it would seem to be no other word than the usual
plural of <i lang="cy">wyr</i>, a grandson, formerly also any
descendant in the direct line. If so, the name of an ancestor must have
originally followed, just as one of the places called Bettws was once
<i lang="cy">Betws Wyrion I&#273;on</i>, &lsquo;the Bettws of
I&#273;on&rsquo;s Descendants&rsquo;; but it is possible that <i lang=
"cy">wyrion</i> in Creu- or Cor-wyrion was itself a man&rsquo;s name,
though I have never met with it. It is right to add that the name
appears in the <i>Record of Carnarvon</i> (pp. 12, 25, 26) as
Creweryon, which carries us back to the first half of the fourteenth
century. There it occurs as the name of a township containing eight
gavels, and the particulars about it might, in the hand of one familiar
with the tenures of that time, perhaps give us valuable information as
to what may have been its status at a still earlier date.</p>

consequence of his having unintentionally touched or hit her with the
iron in the bridle, the fetter, or the stirrup, as on pp. 35, 40, 46,
50, 54, 61. I wish to cite the oldest recorded version, namely from
Walter Mapes&rsquo; curious miscellany of anecdotes and legends
entitled <i lang="la">De Nugis Curialium Distinctiones Quinque</i>.
Mapes flourished in the latter part of the twelfth century, and in
<i lang="la">Distinctio</i> ii. 11 of Thomas Wright&rsquo;s edition,
published in the year 1850, one reads the following story, which serves
the purpose there of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb71" href="#pb71"

Uagelauc.</i></p>
<p>&lsquo;The Welsh relate to us another thing, not so much a miracle
as a portent, as follows. They say that Gwestin of Gwestiniog dwelt
beside Brecknock Mere, which has a circumference of two miles, and that
on three moonlight nights he saw in his field of oats women dancing,
and that he followed them until they sank in the water of the mere; but
the fourth time they say that he seized hold of one of them. Her captor
further used to relate that on each of these nights he had heard the
women, after plunging into the mere, murmuring beneath the water and
saying, &ldquo;If he had done so and so, he would have caught one of
us,&rdquo; and that he had been instructed by their own words,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb72" href="#pb72" name=
"pb72">72</a>]</span>as to the manner in which he caught her. She both
yielded and became his wife, and her first words to her husband were
these: &ldquo;Willingly will I serve thee, and with whole-hearted
obedience, until that day when, desirous of sallying forth in the
direction of the cries beyond the &#7930;yfni, thou shalt strike me
with thy bridle&rdquo;&mdash;the &#7930;yfni is a burn near the mere.
And this came to pass: after presenting him with a numerous offspring
she was struck by him with the bridle, and on his returning home, he
found her running away with her offspring, and he pursued her, but it
was with difficulty that he got hold even of one of his sons, and he
was named Trinio (?) Faglog.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The story, as it proceeds, mentions Trinio engaged in battle with
the men of a prince who seems to have been no other than Brychan of
Brycheiniog, supposed to have died about the middle of the fifth
century. The battle was disastrous to Trinio and his friends, and
Trinio was never seen afterwards; so Walter Mapes reports the fact that
people believed him to have been rescued by his mother, and that he was
with her living still in the lake. Giraldus calls it <i lang="la">lacus
ille de Brecheniauc magnus et famosus, quem et Clamosum dicunt</i>,
&lsquo;that great and famous lake of Brecknock which they also call
<i>Clamosus</i>,&rsquo; suggested by the Welsh <i lang="cy">&#7930;yn
&#7930;efni</i>, so called from the river <i lang="cy">&#7930;efni</i>,
misinterpreted as if derived from <i lang="cy">&#7931;ef</i> &lsquo;a
cry.&rsquo; With this lake he connects the legend, that at the bidding
of the rightful Prince of Wales, the birds frequenting it would at once
warble and sing. This he asserts to have been proved in the case of
Gruffu&#273;, son of Rhys, though the Normans were at the time masters
of his person and of his territory<a class="noteref" id="xd25e7420src"
href="#xd25e7420" name="xd25e7420src">29</a>. After dwelling on the
varying colours of the lake he adds the following
statement:&mdash;<i lang="la">Ad h&aelig;c <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb73" href="#pb73" name="pb73">73</a>]</span>etiam
totus &aelig;dificiis consertus, culturis egregiis, hortis ornatus et
pomeriis, ab accolis quandoque conspicitur</i>, &lsquo;Now and then
also it is seen by the neighbouring inhabitants to be covered with
buildings, and adorned with excellent farming, gardens, and
orchards.&rsquo; It is remarkable as one of the few lakes in Wales
where the remains of a crannog have been discovered, and while Mapes
gives it as only two miles round, it is now said to be about five; so
it has sometimes<a class="noteref" id="xd25e7434src" href="#xd25e7434"
name="xd25e7434src">30</a> been regarded as a stockaded island rather
than as an instance of pile dwellings.</p>
<p>In the <i lang="cy">Brython</i> for 1863, pp. 114&ndash;15, is to be
found what purports to be a copy of a version of the Legend of
&#7930;yn Syfa&#273;on, as contained in a manuscript of Hugh
Thomas&rsquo; in the British Museum. It is to the effect that the
people of the neighbourhood have a story that all the land now covered
by the lake belonged to a princess, who had an admirer to whom she
would not be married unless he procured plenty of gold: she did not
care how. So he one day murdered and robbed a man who had money, and
the princess then accepted the murderer&rsquo;s suit, but she felt
uneasy on account of the reports as to the murdered man&rsquo;s ghost
haunting the place where his body had been buried. So she made her
admirer go at night to interview the ghost and lay it. Whilst he waited
near the grave he heard a voice inquiring whether the innocent man was
not to be avenged, and another replying that it would not be avenged
till the ninth generation. The princess and her lover felt safe enough
and were married: they multiplied and became numerous, while their town
grew to be as it were another Sodom; and the original pair lived on so
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href="#pb74" name=
"pb74">74</a>]</span>astonishingly long that they saw their descendants
of the ninth generation. They exulted in their prosperity, and one day
held a great feast to celebrate it; and when their descendants were
banqueting with them, and the gaiety and mirth were at their zenith,
ancestors and descendants were one and all drowned in a mighty
cataclysm which produced the present lake.</p>
<p>Lastly may be briefly mentioned the belief still lingering in the
neighbourhood, to the effect that there is a town beneath the waters of
the lake, and that in rough weather the bells from the church tower of
that town may be heard ringing, while in calm weather the spire of the
church may be distinctly seen. My informant, writing in 1892, added the
remark: &lsquo;This story seems hardly creditable to us, but many of
the old people believe it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I ought to have mentioned that the fifteenth-century poet Lewis Glyn
Cothi connects with Syfa&#273;on<a class="noteref" id="xd25e7451src"
href="#xd25e7451" name="xd25e7451src">31</a> Lake an <i lang=
"cy">afanc</i> legend; but this will be easier to understand in the
light of the more complete one from the banks of the river Conwy. So
the reader will find Glyn Cothi&rsquo;s words given in the next
chapter. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href="#pb75" name=

the spelling of Welsh names, it may be pointed out for the benefit of
English readers that Welsh <i>f</i> has the sound of English <i>v</i>,
while the sound of English <i>f</i> is written <i>ff</i> (and
<i>ph</i>) in Welsh, and however strange it may seem to them that the
written <i>f</i> should be sounded <i>v</i>, it is borrowed from an old
English alphabet which did so likewise more or less systematically.
<i>Th</i> in such English words as <i>thin</i> and <i>breath</i> is
written <i>th</i>, but the soft sound as in <i>this</i> and
<i>breathe</i> is usually printed in Welsh <i>dd</i> and written in
modern Welsh manuscript sometimes &delta;, like a small Greek delta:

the rare merits of our Welsh bards is their habit of assuming permanent

of excellent native names from falling into utter oblivion in the
general chaos of Anglo-Hebrew ones, such as Jones, Davies, and
Williams, which cover the Principality. Welsh place-names have
similarly been threatened by Hebrew names of chapels, such as Bethesda,
Rehoboth, and Jerusalem, but in this direction the Jewish mania has

Mr. Robert Isaac Jones, at Tremadoc, in the years 1858&ndash;1863, and
edited by the Rev. Chancellor Silvan Evans, who was then the curate of
&#7930;ang&iuml;an in &#7930;eyn: in fact he was curate for fourteen
years! His excellent work in editing the <i lang="cy">Brython</i>
earned for him his diocesan&rsquo;s displeasure, but it is easier to
imagine than to describe how hard it was for him to resign the
honorarium of &pound;24 derived from the <i lang="cy">Brython</i> when
his stipend as a clergyman was only &pound;92, at the same time that he
had dependent on him a wife and six children. However much some people
affect to laugh at the revival of the national spirit in Wales, we
have, I think, got so far as to make it, for some time to come,
impossible for a Welsh clergyman to be snubbed on account of his
literary tastes or his delight in the arch&aelig;ology of his
country.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd25e6690src">&uarr;</a></p>

that the story of the wickedness of the ancient lord of Syfa&#273;on is
assigned as the reason why &lsquo;the superstitious little river
Lewenny will not mix its water with that of the lake.&rsquo;
<i>Lewenny</i> is a reckless improvement of Mapes&rsquo; <i>Leueni</i>
(printed <i>Lenem</i>); and Giraldus&rsquo; <i>Clamosum</i> implies an
old spelling <i lang="cy">&#7930;efni</i>, pronounced the same as the
later spelling <i lang="cy">&#7930;yfni</i>, which is now made into
<i lang="cy">&#7930;ynfi</i> or <i lang="cy">&#7930;ynvi</i>: the river
so called flows through the lake and into the Wye at Glasbury. As to
<i lang="cy">Safa&#273;an</i> or <i lang="cy">Syfa&#273;on</i>, it is
probably of Goidelic origin, and to be identified with such an Irish
name as the feminine <i lang="ga">Samthann</i>: see Dec. 19 in the
Martyrologies. To keep within our data, we are at liberty to suppose
that this was the name of the wicked princess in the story, and that
she was the ancestress of a clan once powerful on and around the lake,
which lies within a Goidelic area indicated by its Ogam
inscriptions.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

<p class="first">The best living authority I have found on the folklore
of Be&#273;gelert, Drws y Coed, and the surrounding district, is Mr.
William Jones, of &#7930;ango&#7931;en. He has written a good deal on
the subject in the <i lang="cy">Brython</i>, and in essays intended for
competition at various literary meetings in Wales. I had the loan from
him of one such essay, and I have referred to the <i lang=
"cy">Brython</i>; and I have also had from Mr. Jones a number of
letters, most of which contain some additional information. In harmony,
moreover, with my usual practice, I have asked Mr. Jones to give me a
little of his own history. This he has been kind enough to do; and, as
I have so far followed no particular order in these jottings, I shall
now give the reader the substance of his letters in English, as I am
anxious that no item should be lost or left inaccessible to English
students of folklore. What is unintelligible to me may not be so to
those who have made a serious study of the subject. Mr. Jones&rsquo;
words are in substance to the following effect:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was bred and born in the parish of Be&#273;gelert,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb76" href="#pb76" name=
"pb76">76</a>]</span>one of the most rustic neighbourhoods and least
subject to change in the whole country. Some of the old Welsh customs
remained within my memory, in spite of the adverse influence of the
Calvinistic Reformation, as it is termed, and I have myself witnessed
several Knitting Nights and Nuptial Feasts (<i lang=
"cy">Neithiorau</i>), which, be it noticed, are not to be confounded
with weddings, as they were feasts which followed the weddings, at the
interval of a week. At these gatherings song and story formed an
element of prime importance in the entertainment at a time when the
Reformation alluded to had already blown the blast of extinction on the
Merry Nights (<i lang="cy">Noswyliau &#7930;awen</i>) and Saints&rsquo;
F&ecirc;tes<a class="noteref" id="xd25e7544src" href="#xd25e7544" name=
"xd25e7544src">1</a> (<i lang="cy">Gwyliau Mabsant</i>) before the days
of my youth, though many of my aged acquaintances remembered them well,
and retained a vivid recollection of scores of the amusing tales which
used to be related for the best at the last mentioned long-night
meetings. I have heard not a few of them reproduced by men of that
generation. As an example of the old-fashioned habits of the people of
Be&#273;gelert in my early days, I may mention the way in which wives
and children used to be named. The custom was that the wife never took
her husband&rsquo;s family name, but retained the one she had as a
spinster. Thus my grandmother on my mother&rsquo;s side was called
Ellen Hughes, daughter to Hugh Williams, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb77" href="#pb77" name="pb77">77</a>]</span>of Gwastad Annas. The
name of her husband, my grandfather, was William Prichard [= <i>W. ab
Rhisiart</i>, or Richard&rsquo;s son], son to Richard William, of the
Efail Newy&#273;. The name of their eldest son, my uncle (brother to my
mother), was Hugh Hughes, and the second son&rsquo;s name was Richard
William. The mother had the privilege of naming her first-born after
her own family in case it was a boy; but if it happened to be a girl,
she took her name from the father&rsquo;s family, for which reason my
mother&rsquo;s maiden name was Catharine Williams. This remained her
name to the day of her death: and the old people at Be&#273;gelert
persisted in calling me, so long as I was at home, William Prichard,
after my grandfather, as I was my mother&rsquo;s eldest child.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Most of the tales I have collected,&rsquo; says Mr. Jones,
&lsquo;relate to the parishes of Be&#273;gelert and Dolwy&#273;elen. My
kindred have lived for generations in those two parishes, and they are
very numerous: in fact, it used to be said that the people of
Dolwy&#273;elen and Be&#273;gelert were all cousins. They were mostly
small farmers, and jealous of all strangers, so that they married
almost without exception from the one parish into the other. This
intermixture helped to carry the tales of the one parish to the other,
and to perpetuate them on the hearths of their homes from generation to
generation, until they were swept away by another influence in this
century. Many of my ancestors seem to have been very fond of stories,
poetry, and singing, and I have been told that some of them were very
skilled in these things. So also, in the case of my parents, the memory
of the past had a great charm for them on both sides; and when the
relatives from Dolwy&#273;elen and Be&#273;gelert met in either parish,
there used to be no end to the recounting of pedigrees and the
repeating of tales for <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb78" href="#pb78"
name="pb78">78</a>]</span>the best. By listening to them, I had been
filled with desire to become an adept in pedigrees and legends. My
parents used to let me go every evening to the house of my grandfather,
William ab Rhisiart, the clerk, to listen to tales, and to hear
edifying books read. My grandfather was a reader &ldquo;without his
rival,&rdquo; and &ldquo;he used to beat the parson hollow.&rdquo; Many
people used to meet at Pen y Bont in the evenings to converse together,
and the stories of some of them were now and then exceedingly eloquent.
Of course, I listened with eager ears and open mouth, in order, if I
heard anything new, to be able to repeat it to my mother. She,
unwilling to let herself be beaten, would probably relate another like
it, which she had heard from her mother, her grandmother, or her old
aunt of Gwastad Annas, who was a fairly good verse-wright of the homely
kind. Then my father, if he did not happen to be busy with his
music-book, would also give us a tale which he had heard from his
grandmother or grandfather, the old John Jones, of Tyn &#7930;an
Dolwy&#273;elen, or somebody else would do so. That is one source from
which I got my knowledge of folklore; but this ceased when we moved
from Be&#273;gelert to Carnarvon in the year 1841. My grandfather died
in 1844, aged seventy-eight.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Besides those,&rsquo; Mr. Jones goes on to say, &lsquo;who
used to come to my grandfather&rsquo;s house and to his workshop to
relate stories, the blacksmith&rsquo;s shop used to be, especially on a
rainy day, a capital place for a story, and many a time did I lurk
there instead of going to school, in order to hear old William
Dafy&#273;, the sawyer, who, peace be to his ashes! drank many a
hornful from the <i>Big Quart</i> without ever breaking down, and old
Ifan Owen, the fisherman, tearing away for the best at their yarns,
sometimes a tissue of lies and sometimes truth. The former was funny,
and a great wag, up to all kinds <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb79"
href="#pb79" name="pb79">79</a>]</span>of tricks. He made everybody
laugh, whereas the latter would preserve the gravity of a saint,
however lying might be the tale which he related. Ifan Owen&rsquo;s
best stories were about the Water Spirit, or, as he called it, <i lang=
"cy">&#7930;amhigyn y Dwr</i>, &ldquo;the Water Leaper.&rdquo; He had
not himself seen the <i lang="cy">&#7930;amhigyn</i>, but his father
had seen it &ldquo;hundreds of times.&rdquo; Many an evening it had
prevented him from catching a single fish in &#7930;yn Gwynan, and,
when the fisherman got on this theme, his eloquence was apt to become
highly polysyllabic in its adjectives. Once in particular, when he had
been angling for hours towards the close of the day, without catching
anything, he found that something took the fly clean off the hook each
time he cast it. After moving from one spot to another on the lake, he
fished opposite the Benlan Wen, when something gave his line a
frightful pull, &ldquo;and, by the gallows, I gave another pull,&rdquo;
the fisherman used to say, &ldquo;with all the force of my arm: out it
came, and up it went off the hook, whilst I turned round to see, as it
dashed so against the cliff of Benlan that it blazed like a
lightning.&rdquo; He used to add, &ldquo;If that was not the <i lang=
"cy">&#7930;amhigyn</i>, it must have been the very devil
himself.&rdquo; That cliff must be two hundred yards at least from the
shore. As to his father, he had seen the Water Spirit many times, and
he had also been fishing in the &#7930;yn Gl&acirc;s or Ffynnon
L&acirc;s, once upon a time, when he hooked a wonderful and fearful
monster: it was not like a fish, but rather resembled a toad, except
that it had a tail and wings instead of legs. He pulled it easily
enough towards the shore, but, as its head was coming out of the water,
it gave a terrible shriek that was enough to split the
fisherman&rsquo;s bones to the marrow, and, had there not been a friend
standing by, he would have fallen headlong into the lake, and been
possibly dragged like a sheep into <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb80"
href="#pb80" name="pb80">80</a>]</span>the depth; for there is a
tradition that if a sheep got into the &#7930;yn Gl&acirc;s, it could
not be got out again, as something would at once drag it to the bottom.
This used to be the belief of the shepherds of Cwm Dyli, within my
memory, and they acted on it in never letting their dogs go after the
sheep in the neighbourhood of this lake. These two funny fellows,
William Dafy&#273; and Ifan Owen, died long ago, without leaving any of
their descendants blessed with as much as the faintest gossamer thread
of the story-teller&rsquo;s mantle. The former, if he had been still
living, would now be no less than 129 years of age, and the latter
about 120.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Jones proceeds to say that he had stories from sources besides
those mentioned, namely, from Lowri Robart, wife of Rhisiart Edwart,
the &lsquo;Old Guide&rsquo;; from his old aunt of Gwastad Annas; from
William Wmffra, husband to his grandmother&rsquo;s sister; from his
grandmother, who was a native of Dolwy&#273;elen, but had been brought
up at Pw&#7931;gwernog, in Nanmor; from her sister; and from
Gruffu&#273; Prisiart, of Nanmor, afterwards of Glan Colwyn, who gave
him the legend of Owen Lawgoch of which I shall have something to say
later, and the story of the bogie of Pen Pwll Coch, which I do not
know. &lsquo;But the chief story-teller of his time at
Be&#273;gelert,&rsquo; Mr. Jones goes on to say, &lsquo;was Twm Ifan
Siams (pronounced Si&#815;&#259;ms or Sh&#259;ms), brother, I believe,
to Dafy&#273; Si&ocirc;n Siams, of the Penrhyn, who was a bard and
pedigree man. Twm lived at Nanmor, but I know not what his vocation
was; his relatives, however, were small farmers, carpenters, and
masons. It is not improbable that he was also an artisan, as he was
conversant with numbers, magnitude, and letters, and left behind him a
volume forming a pedigree book known at Nanmor as the <i lang=
"cy">Barcud Mawr</i>, or &ldquo;Great Kite,&rdquo; as Gruffu&#273;
Prisiart told me. The latter had been reading it many <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb81" href="#pb81" name="pb81">81</a>]</span>a time
in order to know the origin of somebody or other. All I can remember of
this character is that he was very old&mdash;over 90&mdash;and that he
went from house to house in his old age to relate tales and recount
pedigrees: great was the welcome he had from everybody everywhere. I
remember, also, that he was small of stature, nimble, witty,
exceedingly amusing, and always ready with his say on every subject. He
was in the habit of calling on my grandfather in his rambles, and very
cordial was the reception which my parents always gave him on account
of his tales and his knowledge of pedigrees. The story of the afanc, as
given in my collection, is from his mouth. You will observe how little
difference there is between his version<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e7601src" href="#xd25e7601" name="xd25e7601src">2</a> and that
known to Edward &#7930;wyd in the year 1695. I had related this story
to a friend of mine at Portmadoc, who was grandson or great-grandson to
Dafy&#273; Si&ocirc;n Siams, of Penrhyn, in 1858, when he called my
attention to the same story in the <i>Cambrian Journal</i> from the
correspondence of Edward &#7930;wyd. I was surprised at the similarity
between the two versions, and I went to Be&#273;gelert to Gruffu&#273;
Rhisiart, who was related to Twm Si&ocirc;n Siams. I read the story to
him, and I found that he had heard it related by his uncle just as it
was by me, and as given in the <i>Cambrian Journal</i>. Twm Ifan Siams
had funny stories about the tricks of <i lang="cy">Gwrach y Rhibyn</i>,
the <i>Bodach<a class="noteref" id="xd25e7616src" href="#xd25e7616"
name="xd25e7616src">3</a> Glas</i>, and the <i lang="cy">Bwbach
&#7930;wyd</i>, which he localized in Nanmor and &#7930;anfrothen; he
had, also, a very eloquent tale about the courtship between a sailor
from Moel y Gest, near Portmadoc, and a mermaid, of which I retain a
fairly <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href="#pb82" name=
"pb82">82</a>]</span>good recollection. I believe Twm died in the year
1835&ndash;6, aged about ninety-five.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So far, I have merely translated Mr. Jones&rsquo; account of himself
and his authorities as given me in the letter I have already referred
to, dated in June of last year, 1881. I would now add the substance of
his general remarks about the fairies, as he had heard them described,
and as he expressed himself in his essay for the competition on
folklore at the Carnarvon Eiste&#273;fod of 1880:&mdash;The traditions,
he says, respecting the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth Teg</i> vary according to
the situation of the districts with which they are connected, and many
more such traditions continue to be remembered among the inhabitants of
the mountains than by those of the more level country. In some places
the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth Teg</i> are described as a small folk of a
thieving nature, living in summer among the fern bushes in the
mountains, and in winter in the heather and gorse. These were wont to
frequent the fairs and to steal money from the farmers&rsquo; pockets,
where they placed in its stead their own fairy money, which looked like
the coin of the realm, but when it was paid for anything bought it
would vanish in the pockets of the seller. In other districts the
fairies were described as a little bigger and stronger folk; but these
latter were also of a thieving disposition. They would lurk around
people&rsquo;s houses, looking for an opportunity to steal butter and
cheese from the dairies, and they skulked about the cow-yards, in order
to milk the cows and the goats, which they did so thoroughly that many
a morning there was not a drop of milk to be had. The principal
mischief, however, which those used to do, was to carry away unbaptized
infants, and place in their stead their own wretched and peevish
offspring. They were said to live in hidden caves in the mountains, and
he had heard one old man asserting his firm <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href="#pb83" name="pb83">83</a>]</span>belief
that it was beneath Moel Eilio, also called Moel Eilian, a mountain
lying between &#7930;anberis and Cwe&#7931;yn, the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth
Teg</i> of Nant y Bettws lived, whom he had seen many a time when he
was a lad; and, if any one came across the mouth of their cave, he
thought that he would find there a wonderful amount of wealth,
&lsquo;for they were thieves without their like.&rsquo; There is still
another species of <i lang="cy">Tylwyth Teg</i>, very unlike the
foregoing ones in their nature and habits. Not only was this last kind
far more beautiful and comely than the others, but they were honest and
good towards mortals. Their whole nature was replete with joy and fun,
nor were they ever beheld hardly, except engaged in some merry-making
or other. They might be seen on bright moonlight nights at it, singing
and carolling playfully on the fair meadows and the green slopes, at
other times dancing lightly on the tops of the rushes in the valleys.
They were also wont to be seen hunting in full force on the backs of
their grey horses; for this kind were rich, and kept horses and
servants. Though it used to be said that they were spiritual and
immortal beings, still they ate and drank like human beings: they
married and had children. They were also remarkable for their
cleanliness, and they were wont to reward neat maid-servants and
hospitable wives. So housewives used to exhort their maids to clean
their houses thoroughly every night before going to bed, saying that if
the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth Teg</i> happened to enter, they would be sure
to leave money for them somewhere; but they were to tell no one in case
they found any, lest the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth</i> should be offended
and come no more. The mistresses also used to order a tinful of water
to be placed at the foot of the stairs, a clean cloth on the table,
with bread and its accompaniments (<i lang="cy">bara ac
en&#7931;yn</i>) placed on it, so that, if the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth</i>
came in to eat, the maids should <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb84"
href="#pb84" name="pb84">84</a>]</span>have their recompense on the hob
as well as unstinted praise for keeping the house clean, or, as Mr.
Jones has it in a couplet from Goronwy Owen&rsquo;s <i lang=
"cy">Cywy&#273; y Cynghorfynt</i>&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">

<p class="line">Finding the fairies&rsquo; pay on the hob,</p>
<p class="line">With full credit for a clean floor.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">Thus, whether the fairies came or not to pay a visit
to them during their sleep, the house would be clean by the morning,
and the table ready set for breakfast. It appears that the places most
frequently resorted to by this species were rushy combes surrounded by
smooth hills with round tops, also the banks of rivers and the borders
of lakes; but they were seldom seen at any time near rocks or cliffs.
So more tales about them are found in districts of the former
description than anywhere else, and among them may be mentioned
Penmachno, Dolwy&#273;elan, the sides of Moel Siabod,
&#7930;andeg&aacute;i Mountain, and from there to &#7930;anberis, to
Nant&#7931;e Lakes, to Moel Tryfan<a class="noteref" id="xd25e7676src"
href="#xd25e7676" name="xd25e7676src">4</a> and Nant y Bettws, the
upper portion of the parish of Be&#273;gelert from Drws y Coed to the
Pennant, and the district beginning from there and including the level
part of Eifion, on towards Celynnog Fawr. I have very little doubt that
there are many traditions about them in the neighbourhood of the Eifl
and in &#7930;eyn; I know but little, however, about these last. This
kind of fairies was said to live underground, and the way to their
country lay under hollow banks that overhung the deepest parts of the
lakes, or the deepest pools in the rivers, so that mortals could not
follow them further than the water, should they try to go after them.
They used to come out in broad daylight, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb85" href="#pb85" name="pb85">85</a>]</span>two or three together,
and now and then a shepherd, so the saying went, used to talk and chat
with them. Sometimes, moreover, he fell over head and ears in love with
their damsels, but they did not readily allow a mortal to touch them.
The time they were to be seen in their greatest glee was at night when
the moon was full, when they celebrated a merry night (<i lang=
"cy">noswaith lawen</i>). At midnight to the minute, they might be seen
rising out of the ground in every combe and valley; then, joining
hands, they would form into circles, and begin to sing and dance with
might and main until the cock crew, when they would vanish. Many used
to go to look at them on those nights, but it was dangerous to go too
near them, lest they should lure the spectator into their circle; for
if that happened, they would throw a charm over him, which would make
him invisible to his companions, and he would be detained by the
fairies as long as he lived. At times some people went too near to
them, and got snatched in; and at other times a love-inspired youth,
fascinated by the charms of one of their damsels, rushed in foolhardily
to try to seize one of them, and became instantly surrounded and
concealed from sight. If he could be got out before the cock crew he
would be no worse; but once the fairies disappeared without his having
been released, he would never more be seen in the land of the living.
The way to get the captured man out was to take a long stick of
mountain ash (<i lang="cy">pren criafol</i>), which two or more strong
men had to hold with one of its ends in the middle of the circle, so
that when the man came round in his turn in the dance he might take
hold of it, for he is there bodily though not visible, so that he
cannot go past without coming across the stick. Then the others pull
him out, for the fairies, no more than any other spirit, dare touch the
mountain ash. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href="#pb86" name=
"pb86">86</a>]</span></p>
<p>We now proceed to give some of Mr. Jones&rsquo; legends. The first
is one which he published in the fourth volume of the <i lang=
"cy">Brython</i>, p. 70, whence the following free translation is made
of it:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In the north-west corner of the parish of Be&#273;gelert
there is a place which used to be called by the old inhabitants the
Land of the Fairies, and it reaches from Cwm Hafod Ruffy&#273; along
the slope of the mountain of Drws y Coed as far as &#7930;yn y
Dywarchen. The old people of former times used to find much pleasure
and amusement in this district in listening every moonlight night to
the charming music of the fair family, and in looking at their dancing
and their mirthful sports. Once on a time, a long while ago, there
lived at upper Drws y Coed a youth, who was joyous and active, brave
and determined of heart. This young man amused himself every night by
looking on and listening to them. One night they had come to a field
near the house, near the shore of &#7930;yn y Dywarchen, to pass a
merry night. He went, as usual, to look at them, when his glances at
once fell on one of the ladies, who possessed such beauty as he had
never seen in a human being. Her appearance was like that of alabaster;
her voice was as agreeable as the nightingale&rsquo;s, and as unruffled
as the zephyr in a flower-garden at the noon of a long summer&rsquo;s
day; and her gait was pretty and aristocratic; her feet moved in the
dance as lightly on the grass as the rays of the sun had a few hours
before on the lake hard by. He fell in love with her over head and
ears, and in the strength of that passion&mdash;for what is stronger
than love!&mdash;he rushed, when the bustle was at its height, into the
midst of the fair crowd, and snatched the graceful damsel in his arms,
and ran instantly with her to the house. When the fair family saw the
violence used by a mortal, they broke up the dance and ran after her
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href="#pb87" name=
"pb87">87</a>]</span>towards the house; but, when they arrived, the
door had been bolted with iron, wherefore they could not get near her
or touch her in any way; and the damsel had been placed securely in a
chamber. The youth, having her now under his roof, as is the saying,
endeavoured, with all his talent, to win her affection and to induce
her to wed. But at first she would on no account hear of it; on seeing
his persistence, however, and on finding that he would not let her go
to return to her people, she consented to be his servant if he could
find out her name; but she would not be married to him. As he thought
that was not impossible, he half agreed to the condition; but, after
bothering his head with all the names known in that neighbourhood, he
found himself no nearer his point, though he was not willing to give up
the search hurriedly. One night, as he was going home from Carnarvon
market, he saw a number of the fair folks in a turbary not far from his
path. They seemed to him to be engaged in an important deliberation,
and it struck him that they were planning how to recover their abducted
sister. He thought, moreover, that if he could secretly get within
hearing, he might possibly find her name out. On looking carefully
around, he saw that a ditch ran through the turbary and passed near the
spot where they stood. So he made his way round to the ditch, and
crept, on all fours, along it until he was within hearing of the
family. After listening a little, he found that their deliberation was
as to the fate of the lady he had carried away, and he heard one of
them crying, piteously, &ldquo;O Penelop, O Penelop, my sister, why
didst thou run away with a mortal!&rdquo; &ldquo;Penelop,&rdquo; said
the young man to himself, &ldquo;that must be the name of my beloved:
that is enough.&rdquo; At once he began to creep back quietly, and he
returned home safely without having been seen by the fairies.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb88" href="#pb88" name=
"pb88">88</a>]</span>When he got into the house, he called out to the
girl, saying, &ldquo;Penelop, my beloved one, come here!&rdquo; and she
came forward and asked, in astonishment, &ldquo;O mortal, who has
betrayed my name to thee?&rdquo; Then, lifting up her tiny folded
hands, she exclaimed, &ldquo;Alas, my fate, my fate!&rdquo; But she
grew contented with her fate, and took to her work in earnest.
Everything in the house and on the farm prospered under her charge.
There was no better or cleanlier housewife in the neighbourhood around,
or one that was more provident than she. The young man, however, was
not satisfied that she should be a servant to him, and, after he had
long and persistently sought it, she consented to be married, on the
one condition, that, if ever he should touch her with iron, she would
be free to leave him and return to her family. He agreed to that
condition, since he believed that such a thing would never happen at
his hands. So they were married, and lived several years happily and
comfortably together. Two children were born to them, a boy and a girl,
the picture of their mother and the idols of their father. But one
morning, when the husband wanted to go to the fair at Carnarvon, he
went out to catch a filly that was grazing in the field by the house;
but for the life of him he could not catch her, and he called to his
wife to come to assist him. She came without delay, and they managed to
drive the filly to a secure corner, as they thought; but, as the man
approached to catch her, she rushed past him. In his excitement, he
threw the bridle after her; but, who should be running in the direction
of it, but his wife! The iron bit struck her on the cheek, and she
vanished out of sight on the spot. Her husband never saw her any more;
but one cold frosty night, a long time after this event, he was
awakened from his sleep by somebody rubbing the glass of his window,
and, after he had given <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href=
"#pb89" name="pb89">89</a>]</span>a response, he recognized the gentle
and tender voice of his wife saying to him:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Lest my son should find it cold,</p>
<p class="line">Place on him his father&rsquo;s coat;</p>
<p class="line">Lest the fair one find it cold,</p>
<p class="line">Place on her my petticoat.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">It is said that the descendants of this family still
continue in these neighbourhoods, and that they are easy to be
recognized by their light and fair complexion. A similar story is
related of the son of the farmer of Braich y Dinas, in
&#7930;anfihangel y Pennant, and it used to be said that most of the
inhabitants of that neighbourhood were formerly of a light complexion.
I have often heard old people saying, that it was only necessary,
within their memory, to point out in the fair at Penmorfa any one as
being of the breed of the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth</i>, to cause plenty of
fighting that day at least.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The reader may compare with this tale the following, for which I
have to thank Mr. Samuel Rhys Williams, whose words I give, followed by
a translation:&mdash;</p>
<p lang="cy"><i>Yr oe&#273; gwr ieuanc o gymydogaeth Drws y Coed yn

<p>&lsquo;A young man, from the neighbourhood of Drws y Coed, was
returning home one bright moonlight night, from Be&#273;gelert; when he
came opposite the lake called &#7930;yn y Gader, he saw a number of the
ladies known as the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth Teg</i> going through their
nightly frolics. The youth was charmed at once by the beauty of these
ladies, and especially by one of them. He so far lost his control over
himself, that he resolved to leap into the circle and carry away as his
spoil the one who had so completely robbed him of his heart. He
accomplished his intention, and carried the lady home with him. She
became his wife, and children were born to them. Accidentally, while at
some work or other, it happened to him to strike her with iron, and, in
the twinkling of an eye, his beloved one disappeared from his sight. He
saw her no more, except that she came to his bedroom window one night
afterwards, and told him to be tender to the children, and that she was
staying, near the house, in the lake called &#7930;yn y Dywarchen. The
tradition also informs us that this man moved from Drws y Coed to live
at Ystrad near Bettws Garmon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The name &#7930;yn y Dywarchen, I may add, means the Lake of the Sod
or Turf: it is the one with the floating island, described thus by
Giraldus, ii. 9 (p. 135):&mdash;<i lang="la">Alter enim insulam habet
erraticam, vi ventorum impellentium ad oppositas plerumque lacus partes
errabundam. Hic armenta pascentia nonnunquam pastores ad longinquas
subito partes translata mirantur.</i> &lsquo;For one of the two lakes
holds a wandering island, which strays mostly with the force of the
winds impelling it to the opposite parts of the lake. Sometimes cattle
grazing on it are, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href="#pb91"
name="pb91">91</a>]</span>to the surprise of the shepherds, suddenly
carried across to the more distant parts.&rsquo; Sheep are known to get
on the floating islet, and it is still believed to float them away from
the shore. Mr. S. Rhys Williams, it will be noticed, has given the
substance of the legend rather than the story itself. I now proceed to
translate the same tale as given in Welsh in <i lang="cy">Cymru Fu</i>
(pp. 474&ndash;7 of the edition published by Messrs. Hughes and Son,
Wrexham), in a very different dress&mdash;it is from Glasynys&rsquo;
pen, and, as might be expected, decked out with all the literary
adornments in which he delighted. The language he used was his own, but
there is no reason to think that he invented any of the
incidents:&mdash;&lsquo;The farmer of Drws y Coed&rsquo;s son was one
misty day engaged as a shepherd on the side of the mountain, a little
below Cwm Marchnad, and, as he crossed a rushy flat, he saw a
wonderfully handsome little woman standing under a clump of rushes. Her
yellow and curly hair hung down in ringed locks, and her eyes were as
blue as the clear sky, while her forehead was as white as the wavy face
of a snowdrift that has nestled on the side of Snowdon only a single
night. Her two plump cheeks were each like a red rose, and her
pretty-lipped mouth might make an angel eager to kiss her. The youth
approached her, filled with love for her, and, with delicacy and
affection, asked her if he might converse with her. She smiled kindly,
and reaching out her hand, said to him, &ldquo;Idol of my hopes, thou
hast come at last!&rdquo; They began to associate secretly, and to meet
one another daily here and there on the moors around the banks of
&#7930;yn y Gader; at last, their love had waxed so strong that the
young man could not be at peace either day or night, as he was always
thinking of Bella or humming to himself a verse of poetry about her
charms. The yellow-haired youth was now and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb92" href="#pb92" name="pb92">92</a>]</span>then
lost for a long while, and nobody could divine his history. His
acquaintances believed that he had been fascinated: at last the secret
was found out. There were about &#7930;yn y Dywarchen shady and
concealing copses: it was there he was wont to go, and the she-elf
would always be there awaiting him, and it was therefore that the place
where they used to meet got to be called <i lang="cy">&#7930;wyn y
Forwyn</i>, the Maiden&rsquo;s Grove. After fondly loving for a long
time, it was resolved to wed; but it was needful to get the leave of
the damsel&rsquo;s father. One moonlight night it was agreed to meet in
the wood, and the appointment was duly kept by the young man, but there
was no sign of the subterranean folks coming, until the moon
disappeared behind the Garn. Then the two arrived, and the old man at
once proceeded to say to the suitor: &ldquo;Thou shalt have my daughter
on the condition that thou do not strike her with iron. If thou ever
touch her with iron, she will no longer be thine, but shall return to
her own.&rdquo; The man consented readily, and great was his joy. They
were betrothed, and seldom was a handsomer pair seen at the altar. It
was rumoured that a vast sum of money as dowry had arrived with the
pretty lady at Drws y Coed on the evening of her nuptials. Soon after,
the mountain shepherd of Cwm Marchnad passed for a very rich and
influential man. In the course of time they had children, and no
happier people ever lived together than their parents. Everything went
on regularly and prosperously for a number of years: they became
exceedingly wealthy, but the sweet is not to be had without the bitter.
One day they both went out on horseback, and they happened to go near
&#7930;yn y Gader, when the wife&rsquo;s horse got into a bog and sank
to his belly. After the husband had got Bella off his back, he
succeeded with much trouble in getting the horse out, and then
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb93" href="#pb93" name=
"pb93">93</a>]</span>he let him go. Then he lifted her on the back of
his own, but, unfortunately, in trying quickly to place her foot in the
stirrup, the iron part of the same slipped, and struck her&mdash;or,
rather, it touched her at the knee-joint. Before they had made good
half their way home, several of the diminutive <i lang="cy">Tylwyth</i>
began to appear to them, and the sound of sweet singing was heard on
the side of the hill. Before the husband reached Drws y Coed his wife
had left him, and it is supposed that she fled to &#7930;wyn y Forwyn,
and thence to the world below to Faery. She left her dear little ones
to the care of her beloved, and no more came near them. Some say,
however, that she sometimes contrived to see her beloved one in the
following manner. As the law of her country did not permit her to
frequent the earth with an earthly being, she and her mother invented a
way of avoiding the one thing and of securing the other. A great piece
of sod was set to float on the surface of the lake, and on that she
used to be for long hours, freely conversing in tenderness with her
consort on shore; by means of that plan they managed to live together
until he breathed his last. Their descendants owned Drws y Coed for
many generations, and they intermarried and mixed with the people of
the district. Moreover, many a fierce fight took place in later times
at the <i lang="cy">Gwyl-fabsant</i> at Dolbenmaen or at Penmorfa,
because the men of Eifiony&#273; had a habit of annoying the people of
Pennant by calling them Bellisians.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In a note, Glasynys remarks that this tale is located in many
districts without much variation, except in the names of the places;
this, however, could not apply to the latter part, which suits
&#7930;yn y Dywarchen alone. With this account of the fairy wife
frequenting a lake island to converse with her husband on shore,
compare the Irish story of the Children of Lir, who, though
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href="#pb94" name=
"pb94">94</a>]</span>transformed into swans, were allowed to retain
their power of reasoning and speaking, so that they used to converse
from the surface of the water with their friends on the dry land: see
Joyce&rsquo;s <i>Old Celtic Romances</i>, pp. x, 1&ndash;36. Now I
return to another tale which was sent me by Mr. William Jones: unless I
am mistaken it has not hitherto been published; so I give the Welsh
together with a free translation of it:&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;There was a story respecting the son of the farmer of Braich
y Dinas, which used to be told by the late respected Mr. Ellis Owen, of
Cefn y Meusy&#273;, somewhat in the same way as that about the Ystrad
youth, as told by Glasynys; that is to say, the young man enticed one
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb96" href="#pb96" name=
"pb96">96</a>]</span>of the damsels of the fair family to come down
from Moel Hebog, and then he carried her by force into the house, and
afterwards persuaded her to become his wife on the same conditions as
the heir of Ystrad did. But I have heard an old lady called Mrs.
Roberts, who had been brought up at Isa&#7931;t, and who was older than
Mr. Owen, relating it differently. This old woman believed in the truth
of the story, as &ldquo;she remembered some of the family, whatever
anybody may say.&rdquo; She used to spin her yarn somewhat as
follows:&mdash;In old times&mdash;but, for the matter of that, when she
was a young woman&mdash;there were a great many of the fair family
living in certain caves in the Foel from Cwm <span class="corr" id=
"xd25e7779" title=
"Source: Stra&#7931;yn">Str&aacute;&#7931;yn</span><a class="noteref"
id="xd25e7781src" href="#xd25e7781" name="xd25e7781src">5</a> down to
the upper part of Pennant. This <i lang="cy">Tylwyth</i> was much
handsomer than any seen in any other part of the country. In point of
stature they were much bigger than the ordinary ones, fair of
complexion beyond everybody, with hair that was as light as flax, and
eyes that were of a clear blue colour. They showed themselves in one
spot or another, engaged in playing, singing, and jollity every light
night. The sound of their singing used to draw the lads and the young
women to look at them; and, should they be of clear complexion, the
fairies would chat with them; but they would let no person of a dark
hue come near them: they moved away from such a one. Now the young man
of Braich y Dinas was a handsome, vigorous, and lively stripling of
fair, clear, and attractive complexion. He was very fond of looking at
the fair family, and had a chat with some of them often, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb97" href="#pb97" name="pb97">97</a>]</span>but
chiefly with one of the damsels, who surpassed all the rest in beauty
and good sense. The result of frequently meeting was that they fell in
love with one another, but she would not marry him. She promised,
however, to go to service to him, and agreed to meet him at Pant
y&mdash;I have forgotten the rest of the name&mdash;the day after, as
it would not do for her to go with him while the others happened to be
looking on. So he went up the next day to the Foel, and the damsel met
him according to her promise, and went with him home, where she took to
the duties of a dairymaid. Soon everything began to prosper under her
hand; the butter and the cheese were daily growing in quantity. Long
and importunately did the youth try to get her to marry him. She
promised to do so provided he could find out her name. Mrs. Roberts did
not know by what man&oelig;uvre he succeeded in discovering it, but it
was done, and he came into the house one night and called to
&ldquo;Sibi,&rdquo; and when she heard her name she fainted away. When,
however, she recovered her consciousness, she consented to marry on the
condition that he was not to touch her with iron, and that there was
not to be a bolt of iron on the door, or a lock either. It was agreed,
and they were married; they lived together comfortably many years, and
had children born to them. The end came thus: he had gone one day to
cut a bundle of rushes for thatching, and planted the reaping-hook in
the bundle to go home. As he drew towards the haggard, Sibi ran out to
meet him, and he wantonly threw the bundle of rushes towards her, when
she, to prevent its hitting her, tried to stop it with her hand, which
touched the reaping-hook. She vanished on the spot out of sight behind
the bundle of rushes, and nothing more was seen or heard of her.&rsquo;

<p>Mr. Ellis Owen, alluded to above, was a highly respected gentleman,
well known in North Wales for his literary and antiquarian tastes. He
was born in 1789 at Cefn y Meusy&#273; near Tremadoc, where he
continued to live till the day of his death, which was January 27,
1868. His literary remains, preceded by a short biography, were
published in 1877 by Mr. Robert Isaac Jones of Tremadoc; but it
contains no fairy tales so far as I have been able to find.</p>
<p>A tale which partially reminds one of that given by Dewi Glan
Ffrydlas respecting the Corwrion midwife, referred to at p. 63 above,
was published by Mr. W. Jones in the fourth volume of the <i lang=
"cy">Brython</i>, p. 251: freely rendered into English, it runs
thus:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Once on a time, when a midwife from Nanhwynan had newly got
to the Hafo&#273;y&#273; Brithion to pursue her calling, a gentleman
came to the door on a fine grey steed and bade her come with him at
once. Such was the authority with which he spoke, that the poor midwife
durst not refuse to go, however much it was her duty to stay where she
was. So she mounted behind him, and off they went, like the flight of a
swallow, through Cwm&#7931;an, over the Bwlch, down Nant yr Aran, and
over the Gader to Cwm Hafod Ruffy&#273;, before the poor woman had time
even to say Oh! When they reached there, she saw before her a
magnificent mansion, splendidly lit up with such lamps as she had never
seen before. They entered the court, and a crowd of servants in
expensive liveries came to meet them, and she was at once led through
the great hall into a bed-chamber, the like of which she had never
seen. There the mistress of the house, to whom she had been fetched,
was awaiting her. The midwife got through her duties successfully, and
stayed there until the lady had completely recovered, nor had she spent
any part of her <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb99" href="#pb99" name=
"pb99">99</a>]</span>life so merrily, for there nought but festivity
went on day and night: dancing, singing, and endless rejoicing reigned
there. But merry as it was, she found that she must go, and the
nobleman gave her a large purse, with the order not to open it until
she had got into her own house. Then he bade one of his servants escort
her the same way that she had come. When she reached home she opened
the purse, and, to her great joy, it was full of money: she lived
happily on those earnings to the end of her life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>With this ending of the story one should contrast Dewi Glan
Ffrydlas&rsquo; tale to which I have already alluded; and I may here
refer to Mr. Sikes&rsquo; <i>British Goblins</i>, pp. 86&ndash;8, for a
tale differing from both Dewi&rsquo;s and Jones&rsquo;, in that the
fairies are there made to appear as devils to the nurse, who had
accidentally used a certain ointment which she was not to place near
her own eyes. Instead of being rewarded for her services she was only
too glad to be deposited anyhow near her home. &lsquo;But,&rsquo; as
the story goes on to relate, &lsquo;very many years afterwards, being
at a fair, she saw a man stealing something from a stall, and, with one
corner of her eye, beheld her old master pushing the man&rsquo;s elbow.
Unthinkingly she said, &ldquo;How are you, master? how are the
children?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;How did you see me?&rdquo; She
answered, &ldquo;With the corner of my left eye.&rdquo; From that
moment she was blind of her left eye, and lived many years with only
her right.&rsquo; Such is the end of this tale given by Mr. Sikes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But the fair family did not,&rsquo; Mr. William Jones goes on
to say, &lsquo;always give mortals the means of good living: sometimes
they made no little fun of them. Once on a time the Drws y Coed man was
going home from Be&#273;gelert Fair, rather merry than sad, along the
old road over the Gader, when he saw, on coming near <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb100" href="#pb100" name="pb100">100</a>]</span>the
top of the Gader, a fine, handsome house near the road, in which there
was a rare merrymaking. He knew perfectly well that there was no such a
building anywhere on his way, and it made him think that he had lost
his way and gone astray; so he resolved to turn into the house to ask
for lodgings, which were given him. At once, when he entered, he took
it to be a nuptial feast (<i lang="cy">neithior</i>) by reason of the
jollity, the singing, and the dancing. The house was full of young men,
young women, and children, all merry, and exerting themselves to the
utmost. The company began to disappear one by one, and he asked if he
might go to bed, whereupon he was led to a splendid chamber, where
there was a bed of the softest down with snow-white clothes on it. He
stripped at once, went into it, and slept quietly enough till the
morning. The first thing to come to his mind when he lay half asleep,
half awake, was the jollity of the night before, and the fact of his
sleeping in a splendid chamber in the strange house. He opened his eyes
to survey his bedroom, but it was too wide: he was sleeping on the bare
swamp, with a clump of rushes as his pillow, and the blue sky as his
coverlet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Jones mentions that, within his memory, there were still people
in his neighbourhood who believed that the fairies stole unbaptized
children and placed their own in their stead: he gives the following
story about the farmer&rsquo;s wife of Dyffryn Mymbyr, near Capel
Curig, and her infant:&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;This woman had given birth to a healthy and vigorous child at
the beginning of the harvest, one wretched and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb102" href="#pb102" name=
"pb102">102</a>]</span>inclement summer. As the homestead was a
considerable distance from church or chapel, and the weather so very
rainy, it was neglected to baptize the child at the usual<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e7837src" href="#xd25e7837" name="xd25e7837src">6</a>
time, that is to say, before it was eight days old. One fine day, in
the middle of this wretched harvest, the mother went to the field with
the rest of the family to try to save the harvest, and left her baby
sleeping in its cradle in its grandmother&rsquo;s charge, who was so
aged and decrepit as to be unable to go much about. The old woman fell
asleep, and, while she was in that state, the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth
Teg</i> came in and took away the baby, placing another in its stead.
Very shortly the latter began to whine and groan, so that the
grandmother awoke: she went to the cradle, where she saw a slender,
wizened old man moving restlessly and peevishly about. &ldquo;Alas!
alas!&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;the old <i lang="cy">Tylwyth</i> have
been here&rdquo;; and she at once blew in the horn to call the mother
home, who came without delay. As she heard the crying in the cradle,
she ran towards it, and lifted the little one without looking at him;
she hugged him, put him to her breast, and sang lullaby to him, but
nothing was of any avail, as he continued, without stopping, to scream
enough to break her heart; and she knew not what to do to calm him. At
last she looked at him: she saw that he was not like her dear little
boy, and her heart was pierced with agony. She looked at him again, and
the more she examined him the uglier he seemed to her. She sent for her
husband home from the field, and told him to search for a skilled man
somewhere or other; and, after a long search, he was told by somebody
that the parson of Trawsfyny&#273; was skilled in the secrets of the
spirits; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb103" href="#pb103" name=
"pb103">103</a>]</span>so he went to him. The latter bade him take a
shovel and cover it with salt, and make the figure of the cross in the
salt; then to take it to the chamber where the fairy child was, and,
after taking care to open the window, to place the shovel on the fire
until the salt was burnt. This was done, and when the salt had got
white hot, the peevish abortion went away, seen of no one, and they
found the other baby whole and unscathed at the doorstep.&rsquo; Fire
was also made use of in Scotland in order to detect a changeling and
force him to quit: see the British Association&rsquo;s <i>Report</i>,
1896, p. 650, where Mr. Gomme refers to Mr. Gregor&rsquo;s <i>Folk-lore
of the North-east of Scotland</i>, pp. 8&ndash;9.</p>
<p>In answer to a question of mine with regard to gossamer, which is
called in North Wales <i lang="cy">edafe&#273; gwawn</i>,
&lsquo;<i lang="cy">gwawn</i> yarn,&rsquo; Mr. Jones told me in a
letter, dated April, 1881, that it used to be called <i lang=
"cy">Rhaffau&rsquo;r Tylwyth Teg</i>, that is to say, the Ropes of the
Fair Family, which were associated with the diminutive, mischievous,
and wanton kind of fairies who dwelt in marshy and rushy places, or
among the fern and the heather. It used to be said that, if a man
should lie down and fall asleep in any such a spot, the fairies would
come and bind him with their ropes so that he could not move, and that
they would then cover him with a sheet made of their ropes, which would
make him invisible. This was illustrated by him by the following tale
he had heard from his mother:&mdash;</p>
<p lang="cy"><i>Clywais fy mam yn adro&#273; chwedl am fab y

<p>&lsquo;I have heard my mother relating a tale about the son of the
farmer of the Ffri&#273;, who, while on his way home from
Be&#273;gelert Fair, saw, somewhere near Pen Cae&rsquo;r Gors, an
endless number of the diminutive family leaping and capering on the
heather tops. He sat him down to look at them, and sleep came over him;
he let himself down on the ground, and slept heavily. When he was so,
the whole host attacked him, and they bound him so tightly that he
could not have stirred; then they covered him with the gossamer sheet,
so that nobody could see him in case he called for help. His people
expected him home early that evening, and, as they found him delaying
till late, they got uneasy about him. They went to meet him, but no
trace of him was seen, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb105" href=
"#pb105" name="pb105">105</a>]</span>and they went as far as the
village, where they were informed that he had started home in good time
with the farmer of Hafod Ruffy&#273;. So they went to the Hafod to see
if he was there; but the farmer told them that they had parted on Glan
y Gors Bridge to go to their respective homes. A minute search was then
made on both sides of the road from there to the Ffri&#273;, but
without finding any trace of him. They kept searching the whole
neighbourhood during the whole of the next day, but in vain. However,
about the same time the following night the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth</i>
came and liberated him, and he shortly woke up, after sleeping through
the previous night and day. When he woke he had no idea where on earth
he was; so he wandered about on the slopes of the Gader and near the
Gors Fawr until the cock crew, when he found where he was, namely, less
than a quarter of a mile from his home.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The late Mr. Owen, of Cefn Meusy&#273;, has already been alluded to.
I have not been able to get at much of the folklore with which he was
familiar, but, in reply to some questions of mine, Mr. Robert Isaac
Jones of Tremadoc, his biographer, and the publisher of the <i lang=
"cy">Brython</i>, so long as it existed, has kindly ransacked his
memory. He writes to me in Welsh to the following effect:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will tell you what I heard from Mr. Owen and my mother when
I was a lad, about fifty-seven years ago. The former used to say that
the people of Pennant in Eifiony&#273; had a nickname, to wit, that of
<i lang="cy">Belsiaid y Pennant</i>, &ldquo;the Bellisians of the
Pennant&rdquo;; that, when he was a boy, if anybody called out <i lang=
"cy">Belsiaid y Pennant</i> at the Penmorfa Fair, every man jack of
them would come out, and fighting always ensued. The antiquary used to
explain it thus. Some two or three hundred years ago, Sir Robert of the
Nant, one of Sir Richard Bulkeley&rsquo;s ancestors, had a son and heir
who was extravagant <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb106" href="#pb106"
name="pb106">106</a>]</span>and wild. He married a gipsy, and they had
children born to them; but, as the family regarded this marriage as a
disgrace to their ancient stem, it is said that the father, the next
time the vagabonds came round, gave a large sum of money to the father
of the girl for taking her away with him. This having been done, the
rumour was spread abroad that it was one of the fairies the youth had
married, and that she had gone with him to catch a pony, when he threw
the bridle at the beast to prevent it passing, and the iron of the
bridle touched the wife; then that she at once disappeared, as the
fairies always do so when touched with iron. However, the two children
were put out to nurse, and the one of them, who was a girl, was brought
up at Plas y Pennant, and her name was <i>Pelisha</i><a class="noteref"
id="xd25e7896src" href="#xd25e7896" name="xd25e7896src">7</a>; her
descendants remain to this day in the Nant, and are called Bellis, who
are believed there, to this day, to be derived from the <i lang=
"cy">Tylwyth Teg</i>. Nothing offends them more than to be reminded of
this.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. R. I. Jones goes on to relate another tale as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p lang="cy"><i>Dywedir fod &#7931;e a elwir yr Hafod Rugog mewn cwm
anial yn y myny&#273; &#7931;e y by&#273;ai y Tylwyth Teg yn arferol a

boen cyffyr&#273;o&#273; yny ty a&rsquo;i thrwyn yr hwn a estynno&#273;
hanner &#7931;ath.</i> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb107" href=
"#pb107" name="pb107">107</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;It is said that there was a place called Hafod Rugog in a
wild hollow among the mountains, where the fair family were in the
habit of resorting, and that they used to trouble the old woman of
Hafod for the loan of one thing and another. So she said, one day,
&ldquo;You shall have the loan if you will grant me two first
things&mdash;that the first thing I touch at the door break, and that
the first thing I put my hand on in the house be lengthened half a
yard.&rdquo; There was a grip stone (<i lang="cy">carreg afael</i>), as
it is called, in the wall near the door, which was in her way, and she
had in the house a piece of flannel for a jerkin which was half a yard
too short. But, unfortunately, as she came, with her kreel full of turf
on her back, to the house, she nearly fell down: she put her hand, in
order to save herself, to her knee-joint, which then broke; and, owing
to the pain, when she had got into the house, she touched her nose with
her hand, when her nose grew half a yard longer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Jones went on to notice how the old folks used to believe that
the fairies were wont to appear in the marshes near Cwe&#7931;yn Lake,
not far from Rhyd-&#272;u, to sing and dance, and that it was
considered dangerous to approach them on those occasions lest one
should be fascinated. As to the above-mentioned flannel and stone a
folklorist asks me, why the old woman did not definitely mention them
and say exactly what she wanted. The question is worth asking: I cannot
answer it, but I mention it in the hope that somebody else will.</p>

<p class="first">Early in the year 1899<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e7937src" href="#xd25e7937" name="xd25e7937src">8</a> I had a
small group of stories communicated to me by the Rev. W. Evans Jones,
rector of Dolbenmaen, who tells me that the neighbourhood <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href="#pb108" name="pb108">108</a>]</span>of
the Garn abounds in fairy tales. The scene of one of these is located
near the source of Afon fach Blaen y Cae, a tributary of the Dwyfach.
&lsquo;There a shepherd while looking after his flock came across a
ring of rushes which he accidentally kicked, as the little people were
coming out to dance. They detained him, and he married one of their
number. He was told that he would live happily with them as long as he
would not touch any instrument of iron. For years nothing happened to
mar the peace and happiness of the family. One day, however, he
unknowingly touched iron, with the consequence that both the wife and
the children disappeared.&rsquo; This differs remarkably from stories
such as have been already mentioned at pp. 32, 35; but until it is
countenanced by stories from other sources, I can only treat it as a
blurred version of a story of the more usual type, such as the next one
which Mr. Evans Jones has sent me as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A son of the farmer of Blaen Pennant married a fairy and they
lived together happily for years, until one day he took a bridle to
catch a horse, which proved to be rather an obstreperous animal, and in
trying to prevent the horse passing, he threw the bridle at him, which,
however, missed the animal and hit the wife so that the bit touched
her, and she at once disappeared. The tradition goes, that their
descendants are to this day living in the Pennant Valley; and if there
is any unpleasantness between them and their neighbours they are
taunted with being of the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth Teg</i> family.&rsquo;
These are, I presume, the people nicknamed <i lang="cy">Belsiaid</i>,
to which reference has already been made.</p>
<p>The next story is about an old woman from Garn Dolbenmaen who was
crossing y Graig Goch, &lsquo;the Red Rock,&rsquo; &lsquo;when suddenly
she came across a fairy sitting down with a very large number of gold
coins by <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb109" href="#pb109" name=
"pb109">109</a>]</span>her. The old woman ventured to remark how
wealthy she was: the fairy replied, <i lang="cy">Wele dacw</i>,
&ldquo;Lo there!&rdquo; and immediately disappeared.&rsquo; This looks
as if it ought to be a part of a longer story which Mr. Evans Jones has
not heard.</p>
<p>The last bit of folklore which he has communicated is equally short,
but of a rarer description: &lsquo;A fairy was in the habit of
attending a certain family in the Pennant Valley every evening to put
the children to bed; and as the fairy was poorly clad, the mistress of
the house gave her a gown, which was found in the morning torn into
shreds.&rsquo; The displeasure of the fairy at being offered the gown
is paralleled by that of the fenodyree or the Manx brownie, described
in chapter iv. As for the kind of service here ascribed to the Pennant
fairy, I know nothing exactly parallel.</p>

<p class="first">The next four stories are to be found in <i lang=
"cy">Cymru Fu</i> at pp. 175&ndash;9, whence I have taken the liberty
of translating them into English. They were contributed by Glasynys,
whose name has already occurred so often in connexion with these Welsh
legends, that the reader ought to know more about him; but I have been
disappointed in my attempt to get a short account of his life to insert
here. All I can say is, that I made his acquaintance in 1865 in
Anglesey: at that time he had a curacy near Holyhead, and he was in the
prime of life. He impressed me as an enthusiast for Welsh antiquities:
he was born and bred, I believe, in the neighbourhood of Snowdon, and
his death took place about ten years ago. It would be a convenience to
the student of Welsh folklore to have a brief biography of Glasynys,
but as yet nothing of the kind seems to have been written. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb110" href="#pb110" name="pb110">110</a>]</span></p>
<p>(1) &lsquo;When the people of the Gors Goch one evening had just
gone to bed, they heard a great row and disturbance around the house.
One could not comprehend at all what it was that made a noise at that
time of night. Both the husband and the wife had waked up, quite unable
to make out what it might be. The children also woke, but no one could
utter a word: their tongues had all stuck to the roof of their mouths.
The husband, however, at last managed to move, and to ask, &ldquo;Who
is there? What do you want?&rdquo; Then he was answered from without by
a small silvery voice, &ldquo;It is room we want to dress our
children.&rdquo; The door was opened: a dozen small beings came in, and
began to search for an earthen pitcher with water; there they remained
for some hours, washing and titivating themselves. As the day was
breaking, they went away, leaving behind them a fine present for the
kindness they had received. Often afterwards did the Gors Goch folks
have the company of this family. But once there happened to be there a
fine plump and pretty baby in his cradle. The fair family came, and, as
the baby had not been baptized, they took the liberty of changing him
for one of their own. They left behind in his stead an abominable
creature that would do nothing but cry and scream every day of the
week. The mother was nearly breaking her heart on account of the
misfortune, and greatly afraid of telling anybody about it. But
everybody got to see that there was something wrong at the Gors Goch,
which was proved before long by the mother dying of longing for her
child. The other children died broken-hearted after their mother, and
the husband was left alone with the little elf without any one to
comfort them. But shortly after, one began to resort again to the
hearth of the Gors Goch to dress children, and the gift, which had
formerly been silver money, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb111" href=
"#pb111" name="pb111">111</a>]</span>became henceforth pure gold. In
the course of a few years the elf became the heir of a large farm in
North Wales, and that is why the old people used to say, &ldquo;Shoe
the elf with gold and he will grow&rdquo; (<i lang="cy">Fe &#273;aw
gwi&#273;on yn fawr ond ei bedoli ag aur</i>). That is the legend of
the Gors Goch.&rsquo;</p>
<p>(2) &lsquo;Once when William Ellis, of the Gilwern, was fishing on
the bank of Cwm Silin Lake on a dark misty day, he had seen no living
Christian from the time when he left Nant&#7931;e. But as he was in a
happy mood, throwing his line, he beheld over against him in a clump of
rushes a large crowd of people, or things in the shape of people about
a foot in stature: they were engaged in leaping and dancing. He looked
on for hours, and he never heard, as he said, such music in his life
before. But William went too near them, when they threw a kind of dust
into his eyes, and, while he was wiping it away, the little family took
the opportunity of betaking themselves somewhere out of his sight, so
that he neither saw nor heard anything more of them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>(3) &lsquo;There is a similar story respecting a place called
&#7930;yn y Ffynhonnau. There was no end of jollity there, of dancing,
harping, and fiddling, with the servant man of Ge&#7931;i Ffrydau and
his two dogs in the midst of the crowd, leaping and capering as nimbly
as anybody else. At it they were for three days and three nights,
without stopping; and had it not been for a skilled man, who lived not
far off, and came to know how things were going on, the poor fellow
would, without doubt, have danced himself to death. But he was rescued
that time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>(4) The fourth story is one, of which he says, that he heard it from
his mother; but he has elaborated it in his usual fashion, and the
proper names are undoubtedly his own:&mdash;&lsquo;Once on a time, a
shepherd boy had gone <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb112" href=
"#pb112" name="pb112">112</a>]</span>up the mountain. That day, like
many a day before and after, was exceedingly misty. Now, though he was
well acquainted with the place, he lost his way, and walked backwards
and forwards for many a long hour. At last he got into a low rushy
spot, where he saw before him many circular rings. He at once recalled
the place, and began to fear the worst. He had heard, many hundreds of
times, of the bitter experiences, in those rings, of many a shepherd
who had happened to chance on the dancing place or the circles of the
fair family. He hastened away as fast as ever he could, lest he should
be ruined like the rest; but, though he exerted himself to the point of
perspiring and losing his breath, there he was, and there he continued
to be, a long time. At last he was met by an old fat little man, with
merry blue eyes, who asked him what he was doing. He answered that he
was trying to find his way home. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;come
after me, and do not utter a word until I bid thee.&rdquo; This he did,
following him on and on until they came to an oval stone; and the old
fat little man lifted it, after tapping the middle of it three times
with his walking-stick. There was there a narrow path with stairs
visible here and there; and a sort of whitish light, inclining to grey
and blue, was to be seen radiating from the stones. &ldquo;Follow me
fearlessly,&rdquo; said the fat man; &ldquo;no harm will be done
thee.&rdquo; So on the poor youth went, as reluctantly as a dog to be
hanged. But presently a fine, wooded, fertile country spread itself out
before them, with well arranged mansions dotting it all over, while
every kind of apparent magnificence met the eye and seemed to smile in
the landscape; the bright waters of the rivers meandered in twisted
streams, and the hills were covered with the luxuriant verdure of their
grassy growth, and the mountains with a glossy fleece of smooth
pasture. By the time they had <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb113"
href="#pb113" name="pb113">113</a>]</span>reached the stout
gentleman&rsquo;s mansion, the young man&rsquo;s senses had been
bewildered by the sweet cadence of the music which the birds poured
forth from the groves: then there was gold dazzling his eyes, and
silver flashing on his sight. He saw there all kinds of musical
instruments and all sorts of things for playing; but he could discern
no inhabitant in the whole place; and, when he sat down to eat, the
dishes on the table came to their places of themselves, and disappeared
when one had done with them. This puzzled him beyond measure; moreover,
he heard people talking together around him, but for the life of him he
could see no one but his old friend. At length the fat man said to him:
&ldquo;Thou canst now talk as much as it may please thee;&rdquo; but,
when he attempted to move his tongue, it would no more stir than if it
had been a lump of ice, which greatly frightened him. At this point, a
fine old lady, with health and benevolence beaming in her face, came to
them and slightly smiled at the shepherd: the mother was followed by
her three daughters, who were remarkably beautiful. They gazed with
somewhat playful looks at him, and at length began to talk to him; but
his tongue would not wag. Then one of the girls came to him, and,
playing with his yellow and curly locks, gave him a smart kiss on his
ruddy lips. This loosened the string that bound his tongue, and he
began to talk freely and eloquently. There he was, under the charm of
that kiss, in the bliss of happiness; and there he remained a year and
a day without knowing that he had passed more than a day among them;
for he had got into a country where there was no reckoning of time. But
by-and-by he began to feel somewhat of a longing to visit his old home,
and asked the stout man if he might go. &ldquo;Stay a little
yet,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and thou shalt go for awhile.&rdquo; That
passed: he stayed on, but Olwen, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb114"
href="#pb114" name="pb114">114</a>]</span>for that was the name of the
damsel that had kissed him, was very unwilling that he should depart.
She looked sad every time he talked of going away; nor was he himself
without feeling a sort of a cold thrill passing through him at the
thought of leaving her. On condition, however, of returning, he
obtained leave to go, provided with plenty of gold and silver, of
trinkets and gems. When he reached home, nobody knew who he was: it had
been the belief that he had been killed by another shepherd, who found
it necessary to betake himself hastily far away to America, lest he
should be hanged without delay. But here is Einion L&acirc;s at home,
and everybody wonders especially to see that the shepherd had got to
look like a wealthy man: his manners, his dress, his language, and the
treasure he had with him, all conspired to give him the air of a
gentleman. He went back one Thursday night, the first of the moon of
that month, as suddenly as he had left the first time, and nobody knew
whither. There was great joy in the country below when Einion returned
thither, and nobody was more rejoiced at it than Olwen his beloved. The
two were right impatient to get married; but it was necessary to do
that quietly, for the family below hated nothing more than fuss and
noise; so, in a sort of a half-secret fashion, they were wedded. Einion
was very desirous to go once more among his own people, accompanied, to
be sure, by his wife. After he had been long entreating the old man for
leave, they set out on two white ponies, that were, in fact, more like
snow than anything else in point of colour. So he arrived with his
consort in his old home, and it was the opinion of all that
Einion&rsquo;s wife was the handsomest person they had anywhere seen.
Whilst at home, a son was born to them, to whom they gave the name of
Taliessin. Einion was now in the enjoyment of high <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb115" href="#pb115" name=
"pb115">115</a>]</span>repute, and his wife received due respect. Their
wealth was immense, and soon they acquired a large estate; but it was
not long till people began to inquire after the pedigree of
Einion&rsquo;s wife: the country was of opinion that it was not the
right thing to be without a pedigree. Einion was questioned about it,
but without giving any satisfactory answer, and one came to the
conclusion that she was one of the fair family (<i lang="cy">Tylwyth
Teg</i>). &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; replied Einion, &ldquo;there can be
no doubt that she comes from a very fair family; for she has two
sisters who are as fair as she, and, if you saw them together, you
would admit that name to be a most fitting one.&rdquo; This, then, is
the reason why the remarkable family in the Land of Enchantment and
Glamour (<i lang="cy">Hud a &#7930;edrith</i>) is called the fair
family.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The two next tales of Glasynys&rsquo; appear in <i lang="cy">Cymru
Fu</i>, at pp. 478&ndash;9; the first of them is to be compared with
one already related (pp. 99, 100), while the other is unlike anything
that I can now recall:&mdash;</p>
<p>(5) &lsquo;Cwm&#7931;an was the principal resort of the fair family,
and the shepherds of Hafod &#7930;an used to see them daily in the ages
of faith gone by. Once, on a misty afternoon, one of them had been
searching for sheep towards Nant y Bettws. When he had crossed Bwlch
Cwm&#7931;an, and was hastening laboriously down, he saw an endless
number of little folks singing and dancing in a lively and light-footed
fashion, while the handsomest girls he had ever seen anywhere were at
it preparing a banquet. He went to them and had a share of their
dainties, and it seemed to him that he had never in his life tasted
anything approaching their dishes. When the twilight came, they spread
their tents, and the man never before saw such beauty and ingenuity.
They gave him a soft bed of yielding down, with sheets of the finest
linen, and he went to rest as proud as if he had <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb116" href="#pb116" name="pb116">116</a>]</span>been
a prince. But, alas! next morning, after all the jollity and sham
splendour, the poor man, when he opened his eyes, found that his bed
was but a bush of bulrushes, and his pillow a clump of moss.
Nevertheless, he found silver money in his shoes, and afterwards he
continued for a long time to find, every week, a piece of coined money
between two stones near the spot where he had slept. One day, however,
he told a friend of his the secret respecting the money, and he never
found any more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>(6) &lsquo;Another of these shepherds was one day urging his dog at
the sheep in Cwm&#7931;an, when he heard a kind of low noise in the
cleft of a rock. He turned to look, when he found there some kind of a
creature weeping plenteously. He approached, and drew out a wee lass;
very shortly afterwards two middle-aged men came to him to thank him
for his kindness, and, when about to part, one of them gave him a
walking-stick, as a souvenir of his good deed. The year after this,
every sheep in his possession had two ewe-lambs; and so his sheep
continued to breed for some years. But he had stayed one evening in the
village until it was rather late, and there hardly ever was a more
tempestuous night than that: the wind howled, and the clouds shed their
contents in sheets of rain, while the darkness was such that next to
nothing could be seen. As he was crossing the river that comes down
from Cwm&#7931;an, where its flood was sweeping all before it in a
terrible current, he somehow let go the walking-stick from his hand;
and when one went next morning up the Cwm, it was found that nearly all
the sheep had been swept away by the flood, and that the farmer&rsquo;s
wealth had gone almost as it came&mdash;with the
walking-stick.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The shorter versions given by Glasynys are probably more nearly
given as he heard them, than the longer <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb117" href="#pb117" name="pb117">117</a>]</span>ones, which may be
suspected of having been a good deal spun out by him; but there is
probably very little in any of them of his own invention, though the
question whence he got his materials in each instance may be difficult
to answer. In one this is quite clear, though he does not state it,
namely the story of the sojourn of Elfod the Shepherd in Fairyland, as
given in <i lang="cy">Cymru Fu</i>, p. 477: it is no other than a
second or third-hand reproduction of that recorded by Giraldus
concerning a certain Eliodorus, a twelfth-century cleric in the diocese
of St. David&rsquo;s<a class="noteref" id="xd25e8014src" href=
"#xd25e8014" name="xd25e8014src">9</a>. But the longest tale published
by Glasynys is the one about a mermaid: see <i lang="cy">Cymru Fu</i>,
pp. 434&ndash;44. Where he got this from I have not been able to find
out, but it has probably been pieced together from various sources. I
feel sure that some of the materials at least were Welsh, besides the
characters known to Welsh mythology as Nefy&#273; Naf Neifion, Gwyn ab
Nu&#273;, Gwydion ab D&ocirc;n, Dylan, and Ceridwen, who have been
recklessly introduced into it. He locates it, apparently, somewhere on
the coast of Carnarvonshire, the chief scene being called <i lang=
"cy">Ogof Deio</i> or David&rsquo;s Cave, which so far as I know is not
an actual name, but one suggested by &lsquo;David Jones&rsquo;
locker&rsquo; as sailors&rsquo; slang for the sea. In hopes that
somebody will communicate to me any bits of this tale that happen to be
still current on the Welsh coast, I give an abstract of it
here:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Once upon a time, a poor fisherman made the acquaintance of a
mermaid in a cave on the sea-coast; at first she screeched wildly, but,
when she got a little calmer, she told him to go off out of the way of
her brother, and to return betimes the day after. In getting away, he
was tossed into the sea, and tossed out on the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb118" href="#pb118" name="pb118">118</a>]</span>land
with a rope, which had got wound about his waist; and on pulling at
this he got ashore a coffer full of treasure, which he spent the night
in carrying home. He was somewhat late in revisiting the cave the next
day, and saw no mermaid come there to meet him according to her
promise. But the following night he was roused out of his sleep by a
visit from her at his home, when she told him to come in time next day.
On his way thither, he learnt from some fishermen that they had been
labouring in vain during the night, as a great big mermaid had opened
their nets in order to pick the best fish, while she let the rest
escape. When he reached the cave he found the mermaid there combing her
hair: she surprised him by telling him that she had come to live among
the inhabitants of the land, though she was, according to her own
account, a king&rsquo;s daughter. She was no longer stark naked, but
dressed like a lady: in one hand she held a diadem of pure gold, and in
the other a cap of wonderful workmanship, the former of which she
placed on her head, while she handed the latter to Ifan Morgan, with
the order that he should keep it. Then she related to him how she had
noticed him when he was a ruddy boy, out fishing in his father&rsquo;s
white boat, and heard him sing a song which made her love him, and how
she had tried to repeat this song at her father&rsquo;s court, where
everybody wanted to get it. Many a time, she said, she had been
anxiously listening if she might hear it again, but all in vain. So she
had obtained permission from her family to come with her treasures and
see if he would not teach it her; but she soon saw that she would not
succeed without appearing in the form in which she now was. After
saying that her name was Nefyn, daughter of Nefy&#273; Naf Neifion, and
niece to Gwyn son of Nu&#273;, and Gwydion son of D&ocirc;n, she calmed
his feelings on <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb119" href="#pb119"
name="pb119">119</a>]</span>the subject of the humble cottage in which
he lived. Presently he asked her to be his wife, and she consented on
the condition that he should always keep the cap she had given him out
of her sight and teach her the song. They were married and lived
happily together, and had children born them five times, a son and a
daughter each time; they frequently went to the cave, and no one knew
what treasures they had there; but once on a time they went out in a
boat pleasuring, as was their wont, with six or seven of the children
accompanying them, and when they were far from the land a great storm
arose; besides the usual accompaniments of a storm at sea, most
unearthly screeches and noises were heard, which frightened the
children and made their mother look uncomfortable; but presently she
bent her head over the side of the boat, and whispered something they
did not catch: to their surprise the sea was instantly calm. They got
home comfortably, but the elder children were puzzled greatly by their
mother&rsquo;s influence over the sea, and it was not long after this
till they so teased some ill-natured old women, that the latter told
them all about the uncanny origin of their mother. The eldest boy was
vexed at this, and remembered how his mother had spoken to somebody
near the boat at sea, and that he was never allowed to go with his
parents to Ogof Deio. He recalled, also, his mother&rsquo;s account of
the strange countries she had seen. Once there came also to Ifan
Morgan&rsquo;s home, which was now a mansion, a visitor whom the
children were not even allowed to see; and one night, when the young
moon had sunk behind the western horizon, Ifan and his wife went
quietly out of the house, telling a servant that they would not return
for three weeks or a month: this was overheard by the eldest son. So he
followed them very quietly until he saw them on the strand, where he
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb120" href="#pb120" name=
"pb120">120</a>]</span>beheld his mother casting a sort of leather
mantle round herself and his father, and both of them threw themselves
into the hollow of a billow that came to fetch them. The son went home,
broke his heart, and died in nine days at finding out that his mother
was a mermaid; and, on seeing her brother dead, his twin sister went
and threw herself into the sea; but, instead of being drowned, she was
taken up on his steed by a fine looking knight, who then galloped away
over the waves as if they had been dry and level land. The servants
were in doubt what to do, now that Nefy&#273; Morgan was dead and
Eilonwy had thrown herself into the sea; but Tegid, the second son, who
feared nothing, said that Nefy&#273;&rsquo;s body should be taken to
the strand, as somebody was likely to come to fetch it for burial among
his mother&rsquo;s family. At midnight a knight arrived, who said the
funeral was to be at three that morning, and told them that their
brother would come back to them, as Gwydion ab D&ocirc;n was going to
give him a heart that no weight could break, that Eilonwy was soon to
be wedded to one of the finest and bravest of the knights of
Gwer&#273;onau &#7930;ion, and that their parents were with Gwyn ab
Nu&#273; in the Gwaelodion. The body was accordingly taken to the
beach, and, as soon as the wave touched it, out of his coffin leaped
Nefy&#273; like a porpoise. He was seen then to walk away arm in arm
with Gwydion ab D&ocirc;n to a ship that was in waiting, and most
enchanting music was heard by those on shore; but soon the ship sailed
away, hardly touching the tops of the billows. After a year and a day
had elapsed Ifan Morgan, the father, came home, looking much better and
more gentlemanly than he had ever done before; he had never spoken of
Nefyn, his wife, until Tegid one day asked him what about his mother;
she had gone, he said, in search of Eilonwy, who had run away from her
husband in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb121" href="#pb121" name=
"pb121">121</a>]</span>Gwer&#273;onau &#7930;ion, with Glanfryd ab
Gloywfraint. She would be back soon, he thought, and describe to them
all the wonders they had seen. Ifan Morgan went to bed that night, and
was found dead in it in the morning; it was thought that his death had
been caused by a Black Knight, who had been seen haunting the place at
midnight for some time, and always disappearing, when pursued, into a
well that bubbled forth in a dark recess near at hand. The day of Ifan
Morgan&rsquo;s funeral, Nefyn, his wife, returned, and bewailed him
with many tears; she was never more seen on the dry land. Tegid had now
the charge of the family, and he conducted himself in all things as
behoved a man and a gentleman of high principles and great generosity.
He was very wealthy, but often grieved by the thought of his
father&rsquo;s murder. One day, when he and two of his brothers were
out in a boat fishing in the neighbouring bay, they were driven by the
wind to the most wonderful spot they had ever seen. The sea there was
as smooth as glass, and as bright as the clearest light, while beneath
it, and not far from them, they saw a most splendid country with
fertile fields and dales covered with pastures, with flowery hedges,
groves clad in their green foliage, and forests gently waving their
leafy luxuriance, with rivers lazily contemplating their own tortuous
courses, and with mansions here and there of the most beautiful and
ingenious description; and presently they saw that the inhabitants
amused themselves with all kinds of merriment and frolicking, and that
here and there they had music and engaged themselves in the most
energetic dancing; in fact, the rippling waves seemed to have absorbed
their fill of the music, so that the faint echo of it, as gently given
forth by the waves, never ceased to charm their ears until they reached
the shore. That night the three brothers <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb122" href="#pb122" name="pb122">122</a>]</span>had the same dream,
namely that the Black Knight who had throttled their father was in
hiding in a cave on the coast: so they made for the cave in the
morning, but the Black Knight fled from them and galloped off on the
waves as if he had been riding for amusement over a meadow. That day
their sisters, on returning home from school, had to cross a piece of
sea, when a tempest arose and sunk the vessel, drowning all on board,
and the brothers ascribed this to the Black Knight. About this time
there was great consternation among the fishermen on account of a
sea-serpent that twined itself about the rocks near the caves, and
nothing would do but that Tegid and his brothers should go forth to
kill it; but when one day they came near the spot frequented by it,
they heard a deep voice saying to them, &ldquo;Do not kill your
sister,&rdquo; so they wondered greatly and suddenly went home. But
that night Tegid returned there alone, and called his sister by her
name, and after waiting a long while she crept towards him in the shape
of a sea-serpent, and said that she must remain some time in that form
on account of her having run away with one who was not her husband; she
went on to say that she had seen their sisters walking with their
mother, and their father would soon be in the cave. But all of a sudden
there came the Black Knight, who unsheathed a sword that looked like a
flame of fire, and began to cut the sea-serpent into a thousand bits,
which united, however, as fast as he cut it, and became as whole as
before. The end was that the monster twisted itself in a coil round his
throat and bit him terribly in his breast. At this point a White Knight
comes and runs him through with his spear, so that he fell instantly,
while the White Knight went off hurriedly with the sea-serpent in a
coil round his neck. Tegid ran away for his life, but not before a
monster more terrible than <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb123" href=
"#pb123" name="pb123">123</a>]</span>anything he had ever seen had
begun to attack him. It haunted him in all kinds of ways: sometimes it
would be like a sea, but Tegid was able to swim: sometimes it would be
a mountain of ice, but Tegid was able to climb it: and sometimes it was
like a furnace of intense fire, but the heat had no effect on him. But
it appeared mostly as a combination of the beast of prey and the
venomous reptile. Suddenly, however, a young man appeared, taking hold
of Tegid&rsquo;s arm and encouraging him, when the monster fled away
screeching, and a host of knights in splendid array and on proudly
prancing horses came to him: among them he found his brothers, and he
went with them to his mother&rsquo;s country. He was especially welcome
there, and he found all happy and present save his father only, whom he
thought of fetching from the world above, having in fact got leave to
do so from his grandfather. His mother and his brothers went with him
to search for his father&rsquo;s body, and with him came Gwydion ab
D&ocirc;n and Gwyn ab Nu&#273;, but he would not be wakened. So Tegid,
who loved his father greatly, asked leave to remain on his
father&rsquo;s grave, where he remains to this day. His mother is wont
to come there to soothe him, and his brothers send him gifts, while he
sends his gifts to Nefy&#273; Naf Neifion, his grandfather; it is also
said that his twin-sister, Ceridwen, has long since come to live near
him, to make the glad gladder and the pretty prettier, and to maintain
her dignity and honour in peace and tranquillity.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The latter part of this tale, the mention of Ceridwen, invoked by
the bards as the genius presiding over their profession, and of Tegid
remaining on his father&rsquo;s grave, is evidently a reference to
<i lang="cy">&#7930;yn Tegid</i>, or Bala Lake, and to the legend of
Taliessin in the so-called <i lang="cy">Hanes</i> or history of
Taliessin, published at the end of the third volume of Lady Charlotte
Guest&rsquo;s <i>Mabinogion</i>. So the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb124" href="#pb124" name="pb124">124</a>]</span>story has undoubtedly
been pieced together, but not all invented, as is proved by the
reference to the curious cap which the husband was to keep out of the
sight of his mermaid wife. In Irish legends this cap has particular
importance attached to it, of which Glasynys cannot have been aware,
for he knew of no use to make of it. The teaching of the song to the
wife is not mentioned after the marriage; and the introduction of it at
all is remarkable: at any rate I have never noticed anything parallel
to it in other tales. The incident of the tempest, when the mermaid
spoke to somebody by the side of the boat, reminds one of Undine during
the trip on the Danube. It is, perhaps, useless to go into details till
one has ascertained how much of the story has been based on genuine
Welsh folklore. But, while I am on this point, I venture to append here
an Irish tale, which will serve to explain the meaning of the
mermaid&rsquo;s cap, as necessary to her comfort in the water world. I
am indebted for it to the kindness of Dr. Norman Moore, of St.
Bartholomew&rsquo;s Hospital, who tells me, in a letter dated March 7,
1882, that he and the Miss Raynells of Killynon heard it from an old
woman named Mrs. Dolan, who lived on the property of the late Mr. Cooke
of Cookesborough, in Westmeath. The following was her
tale:&mdash;&lsquo;There was a man named Mahon had a farm on the edge
of Loch Owel. He noticed that his corn was trampled, and he sat up all
night to watch it. He saw horses, colts and fillies rather, come up out
of the lake and trample it. He chased them, and they fled into the
lake. The next night he saw them again, and among them a beautiful girl
with a cap of salmon skin on her head, and it shone in the moonlight;
and he caught her and embraced her, and carried her off to his house
and married her, and she was a very good housewife, as all those lake
people are, and kept his house <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb125"
href="#pb125" name="pb125">125</a>]</span>beautifully; and one day in
the harvest, when the men were in the fields, she went into the house,
and there she looked on the hurdle for some lard to make
colcannon<a class="noteref" id="xd25e8058src" href="#xd25e8058" name=
"xd25e8058src">10</a> for the men, and she saw her old cap of fish
skin, and she put it on her head and ran straight down into the lake
and was never seen any more, and Mahon he was terribly grieved, and he
died soon after of a decline. She had had three children, and I often
saw them in the Mullingar market. They were farmers, too, on Loch
Owel.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="first">Let me now return to the fresh-water fairies of
Snowdon and give a reference to Pennant&rsquo;s <i>Tours in Wales</i>:
in the edition published at Carnarvon in 1883 we are told, ii. 326, how
Mr. Pennant learned &lsquo;that, in fairy days, those diminutive gentry
kept their revels&rsquo; on the margins of the Snowdon lake, called
&#7930;yn Coch. There is no legend now extant, so far as I can
ascertain, about the &#7930;yn Coch fairies. So I proceed to append a
legend differing considerably from all the foregoing: I owe it to the
kindness of my friend Mr. Howell Thomas, of the Local Government Board.
It was written out by Mr. G. B. Gattie, and I take the liberty of
prefixing to it his letter to Mr. Thomas, dated Walham Grove, London,
S.W., April 27, 1882. The letter runs as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I had quite forgotten the enclosed, which I had jotted down
during my recent illness, and ought to have sent you long ago. Of
course, the wording is very rough, as no care has been taken on that
point. It is interesting, as being another version of a very pretty old
legend which my mother used to repeat. She was descended from a very
old north Welsh family; indeed, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb126"
href="#pb126" name="pb126">126</a>]</span>I believe my esteemed
grandfather went so far as to trace his descent from the great patriot,
Owen Glendower himself! My mother delighted not only in the ancient
folklore legends and fairy tales of the Principality, with which she
was perfectly familiar, but especially in the lovely national melodies,
all of which she knew by heart; and, being highly accomplished, would
never tire of playing or singing them. You will see the legend is, in
the main, much as related by Professor Rhys, though differing somewhat
in the singular terms of the marriage contract. The scene of the
legend, as related by my late mother, was, of course, a lake, the Welsh
name of which I have, unfortunately, forgotten, but it was somewhere, I
think, near &#7930;anberis, and the hero a stalwart young
farmer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The legend itself reads as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;One hot day, the farmer, riding by the lake, took his horse
into the water to drink, and, whilst looking straight down over his
horse&rsquo;s ears into the smooth surface, he became aware of a most
lovely face, just beneath the tide, looking up archly at him. Quite
bewildered, he earnestly beckoned, and by degrees the head and
shoulders which belonged to the face emerged from the water. Overcome
with emotion, and nearly maddened by the blaze of beauty so suddenly
put before him, he leaped from his horse and rushed wildly into the
lake to try to clasp the lovely vision to his heart. As this was a
clear case of &ldquo;love at first sight,&rdquo; the poor young man was
not, of course, answerable for his actions. But the vision had vanished
beneath the waves, to instantly reappear, however, a yard or two off,
with the most provoking of smiles, and holding out her beautiful white
hands towards her admirer, but slipping off into deep water the moment
he approached.</p>
<p>&lsquo;For many days the young farmer frequented the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb127" href="#pb127" name=
"pb127">127</a>]</span>lake, but without again seeing the beautiful
Naiad, until one day he sat down by the margin hoping that she would
appear, and yet dreading her appearance, for this latter to him simply
meant loss of all peace. Yet he rushed on his fate, like the love-sick
shepherd in the old Italian romance, who watched the sleeping beauty,
yet dreaded her awakening:&mdash;<i lang="it">Io perder&ograve; la
pace, quando si sveglier&agrave;!</i></p>
<p>&lsquo;The young man had brought the remains of his frugal dinner
with him, and was quietly munching, by way of dessert, an apple of rare
and delicious quality, from a tree which grew upon a neighbouring
estate. Suddenly the lady appeared in all her rare beauty almost close
to him, and begged him to &ldquo;throw&rdquo; her one of his apples.
This was altogether too much, and he replied by holding out the
tempting morsel, exhibiting its beautiful red and green sides, saying
that, if she really wanted it, she must fetch it herself. Upon this she
came up quite close, and, as she took the apple from his left hand, he
dexterously seized tight hold of her with his right, and held her fast.
She, however, nothing daunted, bawled lustily, at the top of her voice,
for help, and made such an outrageous noise, that at length a most
respectable looking old gentleman appeared suddenly out of the midst of
the lake. He had a superb white beard, and was simply and classically
attired merely in a single wreath of beautiful water-lilies wound round
his loins, which was possibly his summer costume, the weather being
hot. He politely requested to know what was the matter, and what the
young farmer wanted with his daughter. The case was thereupon
explained, but not without the usual amount of nervous trepidation
which usually happens to love-sick swains when called into the awful
presence of &ldquo;Papa&rdquo; to &ldquo;explain their
intentions!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;After a long parley the lady, at length, agreed to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb128" href="#pb128" name=
"pb128">128</a>]</span>become the young man&rsquo;s wife on two
conditions, which he was to solemnly promise to keep. These conditions
were that he was never to strike her with <i>steel</i> or <i>clay</i>
(earth), conditions to which the young man very readily assented. As
these were primitive days, when people were happy and honest, there
were no lawyers to encumber the Holy Estate with lengthy settlements,
and to fill their own pockets with heavy fees; matters were therefore
soon settled, and the lady married to the young farmer on the spot by
the very respectable old lake deity, her papa.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The story goes on to say that the union was followed by two
sons and two daughters. The eldest son became a great physician, and
all his descendants after him were celebrated for their great
proficiency in the noble healing art. The second son was a mighty
craftsman in all works appertaining to the manufacture and use of iron
and metals. Indeed it has been hinted that, his little corracle of
bull&rsquo;s hide having become old and unsafe, he conceived the
brilliant idea of making one of thin iron. This he actually
accomplished, and, to the intense amazement of the wondering populace,
he constantly used it for fishing, or other purposes, on the lake,
where he paddled about in perfect security. This important fact ought
to be more generally known, as it gives him a fair claim to the
introduction of iron ship-building, <i>pace</i> the shades of Beaufort
and Brunel.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of the two daughters, one is said to have invented the small
ten-stringed harp, and the other the spinning-wheel. Thus were
introduced the arts of medicine, manufactures, music, and woollen
work.</p>
<p>&lsquo;As the old ballad says, applying the quotation to the father
and mother:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">They lived for more than forty year</p>
<p class="line xd25e5678">Right long and happilie!</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb129" href="#pb129" name=
"pb129">129</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;One day it happened that the wife expressed a great wish for
some of those same delicious apples of which she was so fond, and of
which their neighbour often sent them a supply. Off went the farmer,
like a good husband that he was, and brought back, not only some
apples, but a beautiful young sapling, seven or eight feet high,
bearing the same apple, as a present from their friend. This they at
once proceeded to set, he digging and she holding; but the hole not
being quite deep enough he again set to work, with increased energy,
with his spade, and stooping very low threw out the last shovelful over
his shoulder&mdash;alas! without looking&mdash;full into the breast of
his wife. She dropped the sapling and solemnly warned him that one of
the two conditions of their marriage contract had been broken. Accident
was pleaded, but in vain; there was the unfortunate fact&mdash;<i>he
had struck her with clay</i>! Looking upon the sapling as the cause of
this great trouble he determined to return it forthwith to his kind
neighbour. Taking a bridle in his hand he proceeded to the field to
catch his horse, his wife kindly helping him. They both ran up, one on
each side, and, as the unruly steed showed no signs of stopping, the
husband attempted to throw the bridle over his head. Not having visited
Mexico in his travels, and thereby learned the use of the lasso, he
missed his horse&rsquo;s head and&mdash;misfortune of
misfortunes&mdash;struck his wife in the face with the iron bit, thus
breaking the second condition. <i>He had struck her with steel.</i> She
no sooner received the blow than&mdash;like Esau&mdash;she &ldquo;cried
with a great and exceeding bitter cry,&rdquo; and bidding her husband a
last farewell, fled down the hill with lightning speed, dashed into the
lake, and disappeared beneath the smooth and glassy waters! Thus, it
may be said that, if an apple&mdash;indirectly&mdash;occasioned the
beginning <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb130" href="#pb130" name=
"pb130">130</a>]</span>of her married life, so an apple brought about
its sad termination.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Such is Mr. Gattie&rsquo;s tale, and to him probably is to be traced
its literary trimming; but even when it is stripped of that accessory,
it leaves us with difficulties of somewhat the same order as those
attaching to some of the stories which have passed through the hands of
Glasynys. However, the substance of it seems to be genuine, and to
prove that there has been a Northwalian tradition which traced the
medical art to a lake lady like the Egeria of the Physicians of
My&#273;fai.</p>

<p class="first">Allusion has already been made to the <i lang=
"cy">afanc</i> story, and it is convenient to give it before proceeding
any further. The <i>Cambrian Journal</i> for 1859, pp. 142&ndash;6,
gives it in a letter of Edward &#7930;wyd&rsquo;s dated 1693, and
contributed to that periodical by the late Canon Robert Williams, of
Rhyd y Croesau, who copied it from the original letter in his
possession<a class="noteref" id="xd25e8135src" href="#xd25e8135" name=
"xd25e8135src">11</a>, and here follows a translation into English of
the part of it which concerns &#7930;yn yr Afanc<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e8138src" href="#xd25e8138" name="xd25e8138src">12</a>, a pool on
the river Conwy, above Bettws y Coed and opposite Capel
Garmon:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I suppose it very probable that you have heard speak of
&#7930;yn yr Afanc, &ldquo;the Afanc&rsquo;s Pool,&rdquo; and that I
therefore need not trouble to inform you where it stands. I think,
also, that you know, if one may trust what the country people say, that
it was a girl that enticed the afanc to come out of his abode, namely
the pool, so as to be bound with iron chains, whilst he <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb131" href="#pb131" name=
"pb131">131</a>]</span>slumbered with his head on her knees, and with
the grip of one hand on her breast. When he woke from his nap and
perceived what had been done to him, he got up suddenly and hurried to
his old refuge, taking with him in his claw the breast of his
sweetheart. It was then seen that it was well the chain was long enough
to be fastened to oxen that pulled him out of the pool. Thereupon a
considerable dispute arose among some of the people, each asserting
that he had taken a great weight on himself and pulled far harder than
anybody else. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said another, &ldquo;it was I,&rdquo;
&amp;c. And whilst they were wrangling in this way, the report goes
that the afanc answered them, and silenced their discontent by
saying&mdash;</p>

<p class="line">The afanc had never left the pool.</p>

</div>
<p class="first">&lsquo;You must understand that some take the afanc to
be a corporeal demon; but I am sufficiently satisfied that there is an
animal of the same name, which is called in English a <i>bever</i>,
seeing that the term <i lang="cy">cei&#7931;ie&rsquo;r afanc</i>
signifies <i>bever stones</i>. I know not what kind of oxen those in
question were, but it is related that they were twins; nor do I know
why they were called <i lang="cy">Ychain Mannog</i> or <i lang=
"cy">Ychain Bannog</i>. But peradventure they were called <i lang=
"cy">Ychain Bannog</i> in reference to their having had many a
fattening, or fattening on fattening (having been for many a year
fattened). Yet the word <i lang="cy">bannog</i> is not a good, suitable
word to signify fattened, as <i lang="cy">bannog</i> is nought else
than what has been made exceeding thick by beating [or fulling], as one
says of a thick blanket made of coarse yarn (<i lang="cy">y gwrthban

Whilst I was dawdling <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb132" href=
"#pb132" name="pb132">132</a>]</span>behind talking about this, the
oxen had proceeded very far, and I did not find their footmarks as they
came through portions of the parish of Doly&#273;-Elan (Lue&#273;og)
until I reached a pass called ever since <i lang="cy">Bwlch
Rhiw&rsquo;r Ychen</i>, &ldquo;the Pass of the Slope of the
Oxen,&rdquo; between the upper parts of Doly&#273;elan and the upper
part of Nanhwynen. In coming over this pass one of the oxen dropped one
of its eyes on an open spot, which for that reason is called <i lang=
"cy">Gwaun Lygad Ych</i>, &ldquo;the Moor of the Ox&rsquo;s Eye.&rdquo;
The place where the eye fell has become a pool, which is by this time
known as <i lang="cy">Pw&#7931; &#7930;ygad Ych</i>, &ldquo;the Pool of
the Ox&rsquo;s Eye,&rdquo; which is at no time dry, though no water
rises in it or flows into it except when rain falls; nor is there any
flowing out of it during dry weather. It is always of the same depth;
that is, it reaches about one&rsquo;s knee-joint, according to those
who have paid attention to that for a considerable number of years.
There is a harp melody, which not all musicians know: it is known as
the <i lang="cy">Ychain Mannog</i> air, and it has a piteous effect on
the ear, being as plaintive as were the groanings of these <i lang=
"cy">Ychain</i> under the weight of the afanc, especially when one of
the pair lost an eye. They pulled him up to &#7930;yn Cwm Ffynnon Las,
&ldquo;the Lake of the Dingle of the Green Well,&rdquo; to which he was
consigned, for the reason, peradventure, that some believed that there
were in that lake uncanny things already in store. In fact, it was but
fitting that he should be permitted to go to his kind. But whether
there were uncanny things in it before or not, many think that there is
nothing good in it now, as you will understand from what follows. There
is much talk of &#7930;yn Cwm Ffynnon Las besides the fact that it is
always free from ice, except in one corner where the peat water of
clear pools comes into it, and that it has also a variety of dismal
hues. The cause of this is, as I suppose, to be <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb133" href="#pb133" name=
"pb133">133</a>]</span>sought in the various hues of the rocks
surrounding it; and the fact that a whirlwind makes its water mixed,
which is enough to give any lake a disagreeable colour. Nothing swims
on it without danger, and I am not sure that it would be very safe for
a bird to fly across it or not. Throw a rag into its water and it will
go to the bottom, and I have with my own ears heard a man saying that
he saw a goat taking to this lake in order to avoid being caught, and
that as soon as the animal went into the water, it turned round and
round, as if it had been a top, until it was drowned&#8202;&hellip;.
Some mention that, as some great man was hunting in the Snowdon
district (Eryri), a stag, to avoid the hounds when they were pressing
on him, and as is the habit of stags to defend themselves, made his
escape into this lake: the hunters had hardly time to turn round before
they saw the stag&rsquo;s antlers (<i lang="cy">mwnglws</i>) coming to
the surface, but nothing more have they ever seen&#8202;&hellip;. A
young woman has been seen to come out of this lake to wash clothes, and
when she had done she folded the clothes, and taking them under her arm
went back into the lake. One man, whose brother is still alive and
well, beheld in a canoe, on this same lake still, an angler with a red
cap on his head; but the man died within a few days, having not been in
his right mind during that time. Most people regard this as the real
truth, and, as for myself, I cannot refuse to believe that such a
vision might not cause a man to become so bewildered as to force on a
disease ending with his death&#8202;&hellip;.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The name &#7930;yn Cwm Ffynnon Las would have led one to suppose
that the pool meant is the one given in the ordnance maps as &#7930;yn
y Cwm Ffynnon, and situated in the mountains between Pen y Gwryd and
the upper valley of &#7930;anberis; but from the writer on the parish
of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb134" href="#pb134" name=
"pb134">134</a>]</span>Be&#273;gelert in the <i lang="cy">Brython</i>
for 1861, pp. 371&ndash;2, it appears that this is not so, and that the
tarn meant was in the upper reach of Cwm Dyli, and was known as
&#7930;yn y Ffynnon Las, &lsquo;Lake of the Green Well,&rsquo; about
which he has a good deal to say in the same strain as that of
&#7930;wyd in the letter already cited. Among other things he remarks
that it is a very deep tarn, and that its bottom has been ascertained
to be lower than the surface of &#7930;yn &#7930;ydaw, which lies 300
feet lower. And as to the afanc, he remarks that the inhabitants of
Nant Conwy and the lower portions of the parish of Dolwy&#273;elan,
having frequent troubles and losses inflicted on them by a huge monster
in the river Conwy, near Bettws y Coed, tried to kill it but in vain,
as no harpoon, no arrow or spear made any impression whatsoever on the
brute&rsquo;s hide; so it was resolved to drag it away as in the
&#7930;wyd story. I learn from Mr. Pierce (Elis o&rsquo;r Nant), of
Dolwy&#273;elan, that the lake is variously known as &#7930;yn (Cwm)
Ffynnon Las, and &#7930;yn Glas or Glaslyn: this last is the form which
I find in the maps. It is to be noticed that the Nant Conwy people, by
dragging the afanc there, got him beyond their own watershed, so that
he could no more cause floods in the Conwy.</p>
<p>Here, as promised at p. 74, I append Lewis Glyn Cothi&rsquo;s words
as to the afanc in &#7930;yn Syfa&#273;on. The bard is dilating in the
poem, where they occur, on his affection for his friend &#7930;ywelyn
ab Gwilym ab Thomas Vaughan, of Bryn Hafod in the Vale of Towy, and
averring that it would be as hard to induce him to quit his
friend&rsquo;s hospitable home, as it was to get the afanc away from
the Lake of Syfa&#273;on, as follows:&mdash;</p>

or waggon drawn by oxen; but whether driven by Hu, or by whom, one is
not told. However, the story must have represented the undertaking as a
failure, and the afanc as remaining in his lake: had it been otherwise
it would be hard to see the point of the comparison.</p>

<p class="first">The parish of &#7930;anfachreth and its traditions
have been the subject of some contributions to the first volume of the
<i lang="cy">Taliesin</i> published at Ruthin in 1859&ndash;60, pp.
132&ndash;7, by a writer who calls himself <i lang="cy">Cofiadur</i>.
It was Glasynys, I believe, for the style seems to be his: he pretends
to copy from an old manuscript of Hugh Bifan&rsquo;s&mdash;both the
manuscript and its owner were fictions of Glasynys&rsquo; as I am told.
These jottings contain two or three items about the fairies which seem
to be genuine:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The bottom of &#7930;yn Cynnwch, on the Nannau estate, is
level with the hearth-stone of the house of D&ocirc;l y Clochy&#273;.
Its depth was found out owing to the sweetheart of one of Siwsi&rsquo;s
girls having lost his way to her from Nannau, where he was a servant.
The <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb136" href="#pb136" name=
"pb136">136</a>]</span>poor man had fallen into the lake, and gone down
and down, when he found it becoming clearer the lower he got, until at
last he alighted on a level spot where everybody and everything looked
much as he had observed on the dry land. When he had reached the bottom
of the lake, a short fat old gentleman came to him and asked his
business, when he told him how it happened that he had come. He met
with great welcome, and he stayed there a month without knowing that he
had been there three days, and when he was going to leave, he was led
out to his beloved by the inhabitants of the lake bottom. He asserted
that the whole way was level except in one place, where they descended
about a fathom into the ground; but, he added, it was necessary to
ascend about as much to reach the hearth-stone of D&ocirc;l y
Clochy&#273;. The most wonderful thing, however, was that the stone
lifted itself as he came up from the subterranean road towards it. It
was thus the sweetheart arrived there one evening, when the girl was by
the fire weeping for him. Siwsi had been out some days before, and she
knew all about it though she said nothing to anybody. This, then, was
the way in which the depth of &#7930;yn Cynnwch came to be
known.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then he has a few sentences about an old house called
Ceimarch:&mdash;&lsquo;Ceimarch was an old mansion of considerable
repute, and in old times it was considered next to Nannau in point of
importance in the whole district. There was a deep ditch round it,
which was always kept full of water, with the view of keeping off
vagabonds and thieves, as well as other lawless folks, that they might
not take the inmates by surprise. But, in distant ages, this place was
very noted for the frequent visits paid it by the fair family. They
used to come to the ditch to wash themselves, and to cross the water
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb137" href="#pb137" name=
"pb137">137</a>]</span>in boats made of the bark of the
rowan-tree<a class="noteref" id="xd25e8303src" href="#xd25e8303" name=
"xd25e8303src">15</a>, or else birch, and they came into the house to
pay their rent for trampling the ground around the place. They always
placed a piece of money under a pitcher, and the result was that the
family living there became remarkably rich. But somehow, after the
lapse of many years, the owner of the place offended them, by showing
disrespect for their diminutive family: soon the world began to go
against him, and it was not long before he got low in life. Everything
turned against him, and in times past everybody believed that he
incurred all this because he had earned the displeasure of the fair
family.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In the <i lang="cy">Brython</i> for the year 1862, p. 456, in the
course of an essay on the history of the Lordship of Maw&#273;wy in
Merioneth, considered the best in a competition at an Eiste&#273;fod
held at Dinas Maw&#273;wy, August 2, 1855, Glasynys gives the following
bit about the fairies of that neighbourhood:&mdash;&lsquo;The side of
Aran Faw&#273;wy is a great place for the fair family: they are ever at
it playing their games on the hillsides about this spot. It is said
that they are numberless likewise about Bwlch y Groes. Once a boy
crossed over near the approach of night, one summer eve, from the Gadfa
to Maw&#273;wy, and on his return he saw near Aber Rhiwlech a swarm of
the little family dancing away full pelt. The boy began to run, with
two of the maidens in pursuit of him, entreating him to stay; but
Robin, for that was his name, kept running, and the two elves failed
altogether to catch him, otherwise he would have been taken a prisoner
of love. There are plenty of their dancing-rings to be seen on the
hillsides between Aber Rhiwlech and Bwlch y Groes.&rsquo; <span class=

<p>Here I would introduce two other Merionethshire tales, which I have
received from Mr. E. S. Roberts, master of the &#7930;andysilio School,
near &#7930;ango&#7931;en. He has learnt them from one Abel Evans, who
lives at present in the parish of &#7930;andysilio: he is a native of
the parish of &#7930;andri&#7931;o on the slopes of the Berwyn, and of
a glen in the same, known as Cwm Pennant, so called from its being
drained by the Pennant on its way to join the Dee. Now Cwm Pennant was
the resort of fairies, or of a certain family of them, and the
occurrence, related in the following tale, must have taken place no
less than seventy years ago: it was well known to the late Mrs. Ellen
Edwards of &#7930;andri&#7931;o:&mdash;</p>
<p lang="cy"><i>Ryw &#273;iwrnod aeth dau gyfai&#7931; i hela dwfrgwn

<p>&lsquo;One day, two friends went to hunt otters on the banks of the
Pennant, and when they were directing their steps towards the river,
they beheld some small creature of a red colour running fast across the
meadows in the direction of the river. Off they ran after it, and saw
that it went beneath the roots of a tree on the brink of the river to
hide itself. The two men thought it was an otter, but, at the same
time, they could not understand why it seemed to them to be of a red
colour. They wished to take it alive, and off one of them went to a
farm house that was not far away to ask for a sack, which he got, to
put the creature into it. Now there were two holes under the roots of
the tree, and while one held the sack with its mouth open over one of
them, the other pushed his stick into the other hole, and presently the
creature went into the sack. The two men thought they had caught an
otter, which they looked upon as no small feat. They set out for home,
but before they had proceeded the width of one field, the inmate of the
sack spoke to them in a sad voice, and said, &ldquo;My mother is
calling for me; oh, my mother is calling for me!&rdquo; This gave the
two hunters a great fright, so that they at once threw down the sack;
and great was their surprise to see a little man in a red dress running
out of the sack towards the river. He disappeared from their sight in
the bushes by the river. The two men were greatly terrified, and felt
that it was more prudent to go home than meddle any further with the
fair family.&rsquo; So far as I know, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb140" href="#pb140" name="pb140">140</a>]</span>this story stands
alone in Welsh folklore; but it has an exact parallel in
Lancashire<a class="noteref" id="xd25e8324src" href="#xd25e8324" name=
"xd25e8324src">16</a>.</p>
<p>The other story, which I now reproduce, was obtained by Mr. Roberts
from the same Abel Evans. He learnt it from Mrs. Ellen Edwards, and it
refers to a point in her lifetime, which Abel Evans fixes at ninety
years ago. Mr. Roberts has not succeeded in recovering the name of the
cottager of whom it speaks; but he lived on the side of the Berwyn,
above Cwm Pennant, where till lately a cottage used to stand, near
which the fairies had one of their resorts:&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;The occupier of the cottage had tilled a small portion of the
mountain side near his home in order to plant potatoes, which he did.
He observed that there was a rook&rsquo;s nest on a tree which was not
far from this spot, and it struck him that it would be prudent to break
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb141" href="#pb141" name=
"pb141">141</a>]</span>the nest before the rooks multiplied. So he
climbed the tree and broke the nest, and, after coming down, he noticed
a green circle (a fairy ring) round the tree, and on this circle he
espied, to his great joy, half a crown. As he went by the same spot the
following morning, he found another half a crown in the same place as
before. So it happened for several days; but one day he told a friend
of his good luck, and showed him the spot where he found half a crown
every morning. Now the next morning there was for him neither half a
crown nor anything else, because he had broken the rule of the fair
folks by making their liberality known, they being of opinion that the
left hand should not know what the right hand does.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So runs this short tale, which the old lady, Mrs. Edwards, and the
people of the neighbourhood explained as an instance of the gratitude
of the fairies to a man who had rendered them a service, which in this
case was supposed to have consisted in ridding them of the rooks, that
disturbed their merry-makings in the green ring beneath the branches of
the tree.</p>

<p class="first">It would be unpardonable to pass away from Merioneth
without alluding to the stray cow of &#7930;yn Barfog. The story
appears in Welsh in the <i lang="cy">Brython</i> for 1860, pp.
183&ndash;4, but the contributor, who closely imitates Glasynys&rsquo;
style, says that he got his materials from a paper by the late Mr.
Pughe of Aberdovey, by which he seems to have meant an article
contributed by the latter to the <i lang="la">Arch&aelig;ologia
Cambrensis</i>, and published in the volume for 1853, pp. 201&ndash;5.
Mr. Pughe dwells in that article a good deal on the scenery of the
corner of Merioneth in the rear of Aberdovey; but the chief thing in
his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb142" href="#pb142" name=
"pb142">142</a>]</span>paper is the legend connected with &#7930;yn
Barfog, which he renders into English as the Bearded Lake<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e8359src" href="#xd25e8359" name=
"xd25e8359src">17</a>. It is described as a mountain lake in a secluded
spot in the upland country behind Aberdovey; but I shall let Mr. Pughe
speak for himself:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The lovers of Cambrian lore are aware that the <i>Triads</i>
in their record of the deluge affirm that it was occasioned by a mystic
Afanc y &#7930;yn, crocodile<a class="noteref" id="xd25e8373src" href=
"#xd25e8373" name="xd25e8373src">18</a> of the lake, breaking the banks
of &#7930;yn &#7930;ion, the lake of waters; and the recurrence of that
catastrophe was prevented only by Hu Gadarn, the bold man of power,
dragging away the afanc by aid of his <i lang="cy">Ychain Banawg</i>,
or large horned oxen. Many a lakelet in our land has put forward its
claim to the location of &#7930;yn &#7930;ion; amongst the rest, this
lake. Be that as it may, King Arthur and his war-horse have the credit
amongst the mountaineers here of ridding them of the monster, in place
of Hu the Mighty, in proof of which is shown an impression on a
neighbouring rock bearing a resemblance to those made by the shoe or
hoof of a horse, as having been left there by his charger when our
British Hercules was engaged in this redoubtable act of prowess, and
this impression has been given the name of Carn March Arthur, the hoof
of Arthur&rsquo;s horse, which it retains to this day. It is believed
to be very perilous to let the waters out of the lake, and recently an
aged inhabitant of the district informed the writer that she
recollected this being done during a period of long <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb143" href="#pb143" name=
"pb143">143</a>]</span>drought, in order to procure motive power for
&#7930;yn Pair Mill, and that long-continued heavy rains followed. No
wonder our bold but superstitious progenitors, awe-struck by the
solitude of the spot&mdash;the dark sepial tint of its waters,
unrelieved by the flitting apparition of a single fish, and seldom
visited by the tenants of the air&mdash;should have established it as a
canon in their creed of terror that the lake formed one of the many
communications between this outward world of ours and the inner or
lower one of Annwn&mdash;the unknown world<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e8393src" href="#xd25e8393" name="xd25e8393src">19</a>&mdash;the
dominion of Gwyn ap Nu&#273;, the mythic king of the fabled realm,
peopled by those children of mystery, Plant Annwn; and the belief is
still current amongst the inhabitants of our mountains in the
occasional visitations of the Gwrage&#273; Annwn, or dames of Elfin
land, to this upper world of ours. A shrewd old hill farmer (Thomas
Abergraes by name), well skilled in the folk-lore of the district,
informed me that, in years gone by, though when, exactly, he was too
young to remember, those dames were wont to make their appearance,
arrayed in green, in the neighbourhood of &#7930;yn Barfog, chiefly at
eventide, accompanied by their kine and hounds, and that on quiet
summer nights in particular, these ban-hounds were often to be heard in
full cry pursuing their prey&mdash;the souls of doomed men dying
without baptism and penance&mdash;along the upland township of
Cefnrhosucha. Many a farmer had a sight of their comely milk-white
kine; many a swain had his soul turned to romance and poesy by a sudden
vision of themselves in the guise of damsels arrayed in green, and
radiant in beauty and grace; and many a sportsman had his path crossed
by their white hounds of supernatural <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb144" href="#pb144" name="pb144">144</a>]</span>fleetness and
comeliness, the Cwn Annwn; but never had any one been favoured with
more than a passing view of either, till an old farmer residing at
Dyssyrnant, in the adjoining valley of Dyffryn Gwyn, became at last the
lucky captor of one of their milk-white kine. The acquaintance which
the Gwartheg y &#7930;yn, the kine of the lake, had formed with the
farmer&rsquo;s cattle, like the loves of the angels for the daughters
of men, became the means of capture; and the farmer was thereby enabled
to add the mystic cow to his own herd, an event in all cases believed
to be most conducive to the worldly prosperity of him who should make
so fortunate an acquisition. Never was there such a cow, never such
calves, never such milk and butter, or cheese, and the fame of the
Fuwch Gyfeiliorn, the stray cow, was soon spread abroad through that
central part of Wales known as the district of Rhwng y &#273;wy Afon,
from the banks of the Maw&#273;ach to those of the Dofwy<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e8399src" href="#xd25e8399" name=
"xd25e8399src">20</a>&mdash;from Aberdiswnwy<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e8402src" href="#xd25e8402" name="xd25e8402src">21</a> to
Abercorris. The farmer, from a small beginning, rapidly became, like
Job, a man of substance, possessed of thriving herds of cattle&mdash;a
very patriarch among the mountains. But, alas! wanting Job&rsquo;s
restraining grace, his wealth made him proud, his pride made him forget
his obligation to the Elfin cow, and fearing she might soon become too
old to be profitable, he fattened her for the butcher, and then even
she did not fail to distinguish herself, for a more monstrously fat
beast was never seen. At last the day of slaughter came&mdash;an
eventful day in the annals of a mountain farm&mdash;the killing of a
fat cow, and such a monster of obesity! No wonder all the neighbours
were gathered together <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb145" href=
"#pb145" name="pb145">145</a>]</span>to see the sight. The old farmer
looked upon the preparations in self-pleased importance&mdash;the
butcher felt he was about no common feat of his craft, and, baring his
arms, he struck the blow&mdash;not now fatal, for before even a hair
had been injured, his arm was paralysed&mdash;the knife dropped from
his hand, and the whole company was electrified by a piercing cry that
awakened echo in a dozen hills, and made the welkin ring again; and lo
and behold! the whole assemblage saw a female figure clad in green,
with uplifted arms, standing on one of the craigs overhanging &#7930;yn
Barfog, and heard her calling with a voice loud as thunder:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div lang="cy" class="lg">
<p class="line"><i>Dere di velen Einion,</i></p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="first">And no sooner were these words of power uttered than
the original lake cow and all her progeny, to the third and fourth
generations, were in full flight towards the heights of &#7930;yn
Barfog, as if pursued by the evil one. Self-interest quickly roused the
farmer, who followed in pursuit, till breathless and panting he gained
an eminence overlooking the lake, but with no better success than to
behold the green attired dame leisurely descending mid-lake,
accompanied by the fugitive cows and their calves formed in a circle
around her, they tossing their tails, she waving her hands in scorn as
much as to say, &ldquo;You may catch us, my friend, if you can,&rdquo;
as they disappeared beneath the dark waters of the lake, leaving only
the yellow water-lily to mark the spot where they <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb146" href="#pb146" name=
"pb146">146</a>]</span>vanished, and to perpetuate the memory of this
strange event. Meanwhile the farmer looked with rueful countenance upon
the spot where the Elfin herd disappeared, and had ample leisure to
deplore the effects of his greediness, as with them also departed the
prosperity which had hitherto attended him, and he became impoverished
to a degree below his original circumstances; and, in his altered
circumstances, few felt pity for one who in the noontide flow of
prosperity had shown himself so far forgetful of favours received, as
to purpose slaying his benefactor.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Pughe did a very good thing in saving this legend from oblivion,
but it would be very interesting to know how much of it is still
current among the inhabitants of the retired district around &#7930;yn
Barfog, and how the story would look when stripped of the florid
language in which Mr. Pughe thought proper to clothe it. Lastly, let me
add a reference to the <i>Iolo Manuscripts</i>, pp. 85, 475, where a
short story is given concerning a certain Milkwhite Sweet-milk Cow
(<i lang="cy">y Fuwch Laethwen Lefrith</i>) whose milk was so abundant
and possessed of such virtues as almost to rival the Holy Grail. Like
the Holy Grail also this cow wandered everywhere spreading plenty,
until she chanced to come to the Vale of Towy, where the foolish
inhabitants wished to kill and eat her: the result was that she
vanished in their hands and has never since been heard of.</p>

<p class="first">Here I wish to add some further stories connected with
Merionethshire which have come under my notice lately. I give them
chiefly on the authority of Mr. Owen M. Edwards of Lincoln College, who
is a native of &#7930;anuwch&#7931;yn, and still spends a considerable
part of his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb147" href="#pb147" name=
"pb147">147</a>]</span>time there; and partly on that of Hywel&rsquo;s
essay on the folklore of the county, which was awarded the prize at the
National Eiste&#273;fod of 1898<a class="noteref" id="xd25e8484src"
href="#xd25e8484" name="xd25e8484src">23</a>. A story current at
&#7930;anuwch&#7931;yn, concerning a midwife who attends on a fairy
mother, resembles the others of the same group: for one of them see p.
63 above. In the former, however, one misses the ointment, and finds
instead of it that the midwife was not to touch her eyes with the water
with which she washed the fairy baby. But as might be expected one of
her eyes happened to itch, and she touched it with her fingers straight
from the water. It appears that thenceforth she was able to see the
fairies with that eye; at any rate she is represented some time
afterwards recognizing the father of the fairy baby at a fair at Bala,
and inquiring of him kindly about his family. The fairy asked with
which eye she saw him, and when he had ascertained this, he at once
blinded it, so that she never could see with it afterwards. Hywel also
has it that the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth Teg</i> formerly used to frequent
the markets at Bala, and that they used to swell the noise in the
market-place without anybody being able to see them: this was a sign
that prices were going to rise.</p>
<p>The shepherds of Ardudwy are familiar, according to Hywel, with a
variant of the story in which a man married a fairy on condition that
he did not touch her with iron. They lived on the Moelfre and dwelt
happily together for years, until one fine summer day, when the husband
was engaged in shearing his sheep, he put the <i lang=
"cy">gwe&#7931;e</i>, &lsquo;shears,&rsquo; in his wife&rsquo;s hand:
she then instantly disappeared. The earlier portions of this story are
unknown to me, but they are not hard to guess. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb148" href="#pb148" name="pb148">148</a>]</span></p>
<p>Concerning &#7930;yn Ir&#273;yn, between the western slopes of the
&#7930;aw&#7931;ech, Hywel has a story the like of which I am not
acquainted with: walking near that lake you shun the shore and keep to
the grass in order to avoid the fairies, for if you take hold of the
grass no fairy can touch you, or dare under any circumstances injure a
blade of grass.</p>
<p>Lastly, Hywel speaks of several caves containing treasure, as for
instance a <i lang="cy">telyn aur</i>, or golden harp, hidden away in a
cave beneath Caste&#7931; Carn Dochan in the parish of
&#7930;anuwch&#7931;yn. Lewis Morris, in his <i>Celtic Remains</i>, p.
100, calls it Caste&#7931; Corndochen, and describes it as seated on
the top of a steep rock at the bottom of a deep valley: it appears to
have consisted of a wall surrounding three turrets, and the mortar
seems composed of cockle-shells: see also the <i lang=
"la">Arch&aelig;ologia Cambrensis</i> for 1850, p. 204. Hywel speaks
also of a cave beneath Caste&#7931; Dinas Br&acirc;n, near
&#7930;ango&#7931;en, as containing much treasure, which will only be
disclosed to a boy followed by a white dog with <i lang=
"cy">&#7931;ygaid arian</i>, &lsquo;silver eyes,&rsquo; explained to
mean light eyes: every such dog is said to see the wind. So runs this
story, but it requires more exegesis than I can supply. One may compare
it at a distance with Myr&#273;in&rsquo;s arrangement that the treasure
buried by him at Dinas Emrys should only be found by a youth with
yellow hair and blue eyes, and with the belief that the cave treasures
of the Snowdon district belong to the <i lang="cy">Gwy&#273;yl</i> or
Goidels, and that Goidels will eventually find them: see chapter
viii.</p>
<p>The next three stories are from Mr. Owen Edwards&rsquo; <i lang=
"cy">Cymru</i> for 1897, pp. 188&ndash;9, where he has published them
from a collection made for a literary competition or local
Eiste&#273;fod by his friend J. H. Roberts, who died in early manhood.
The first is a blurred version of the story of the Lake Lady and her
dowry of cattle, but <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb149" href="#pb149"
name="pb149">149</a>]</span>enough of the story remains to show that,
had we got it in its original form, it would be found to differ
somewhat on several points from all the other versions extant. I
summarize the Welsh as follows:&mdash;In ages gone by, as the shepherd
of Hafod y Garreg was looking after his sheep on the shores of the
Arennig Lake, he came across a young calf, plump, sleek, and strong, in
the rushes. He could not guess whence the beast could have come, as no
cattle were allowed to approach the lake at that time of the year. He
took it home, however, and it was reared until it was a bull,
remarkable for his fine appearance. In time his offspring were the only
cattle on the farm, and never before had there been such beasts at
Hafod y Garreg. They were the wonder and admiration of the whole
country. But one summer afternoon in June, the shepherd saw a little
fat old man playing on a pipe, and then he heard him call the cows by
their names&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div lang="cy" class="lg">

<p class="line"><i>Dowch adre&rsquo;r awrhon ar fy ngair.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Mulican, Molican, Malen and Mair,</p>
<p class="line">Come now home at my word.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">He then beheld the whole herd running to the little
man and going into the lake. Nothing more was heard of them, and it was
everybody&rsquo;s opinion that they were the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth
Teg&rsquo;s</i> cattle.</p>
<p>The next is a quasi fairy tale, the outcome of which recalls the
adventure of the farmer of Drws y Coed on his return from
Be&#273;gelert Fair, p. 99 above. It is told of a young harpist who was
making his way across country from his home at Yspyty Ifan to the
neighbourhood of Bala, that while crossing the mountain he happened in
the mist to lose his road and fall into the Gors Fawr, &lsquo;the big
bog.&rsquo; There he wallowed for hours, quite unable to extricate
himself in spite of all his efforts. But when he was going to give up
in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb150" href="#pb150" name=
"pb150">150</a>]</span>despair, he beheld close to him, reaching him
her hand, a little woman who was wondrous fair beyond all his
conception of beauty, and with her help he got out of the Gors. The
damsel gave him a jolly sweet kiss that flashed electricity through his
whole nature: he was at once over head and ears in love. She led him to
the hut of her father and mother: there he had every welcome, and he
spent the night singing and dancing with Olwen, for that was her name.
Now, though the harpist was a mere stripling, he thought of wedding at
once&mdash;he was never before in such a heaven of delight. But next
morning he was waked, not by a kiss from Olwen, but by the Plas Drain
shepherd&rsquo;s dog licking his lips: he found himself sleeping
against the wall of a sheepfold (<i lang="cy">corlan</i>), with his
harp in a clump of rushes at his feet, without any trace to be found of
the family with whom he had spent such a happy night.</p>
<p>The next story recalls Glasynys&rsquo; Einion Las, as given at pp.
111&ndash;5 above: its peculiarity is the part played by the well
introduced. The scene was a turbary near the river called Afon Mynach,
so named from Cwm Tir Mynach, behind the hills immediately north of
Bala:&mdash;Ages ago, as a number of people were cutting turf in a
place which was then moorland, and which is now enclosed ground forming
part of a farm called Nant Hir, one of them happened to wash his face
in a well belonging to the fairies. At dinner-time in the middle of the
day they sat down in a circle, while the youth who had washed his face
went to fetch the food, but suddenly both he and the box of food were
lost. They knew not what to do, they suspected that it was the doing of
the fairies; but the wise man (<i lang="cy">gwr hyspys</i>) came to the
neighbourhood and told them, that, if they would only go to the spot on
the night of full moon in June, they would <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb151" href="#pb151" name=
"pb151">151</a>]</span>behold him dancing with the fairies. They did as
they were told, and found the moor covered with thousands of little
agile creatures who sang and danced with all their might, and they saw
the missing man among them. They rushed at him, and with a great deal
of trouble they got him out. But oftentimes was Einion missed again,
until at the time of full moon in another June he returned home with a
wondrously fair wife, whose history or pedigree no one knew. Everybody
believed her to be one of the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth Teg</i>.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is a kind of fairy tale of which I think I have
hitherto not given the reader a specimen: a good instance is given in
the third volume of the <i lang="cy">Brython</i>, at p. 459, by a
contributor who calls himself Idnerth ab Gwgan, who, I learn from the
Rev. Chancellor Silvan Evans, the editor, was no other than the Rev.
Benjamin Williams, best known to Welsh antiquaries by his bardic name
of Gwyniony&#273;. The preface to the tale is also interesting, so I am
tempted to render the whole into English, as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The fair family were wonderful creatures in the imaginary
world: they encamped, they walked, and they capered a great deal in
former ages in our country, according to what we learn from some of our
old people. It may be supposed that they were very little folks like
the children of <i lang="cy">Rhys &#272;wfn</i>; for the old people
used to imagine that they were wont to visit their hearths in great
numbers in ages gone by. The girls at the farm houses used to make the
hearths clean after supper, and to place a cauldron full of water near
the fire; and so they thought that the fair family came there to play
at night, bringing sweethearts for the young women, and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb152" href="#pb152" name=
"pb152">152</a>]</span>leaving pieces of money on the hob for them in
the morning. Sometimes they might be seen as splendid hosts exercising
themselves on our hills. They were very fond of the mountains of Dyfed;
travellers between Lampeter and Cardigan used to see them on the hill
of &#7930;anwenog, but by the time they had reached there the fairies
would be far away on the hills of &#7930;andyssul, and when one had
reached the place where one expected to see the family together in tidy
array, they would be seen very busily engaged on the tops of Crug y
Balog; when one went there they would be on Blaen Pant ar Fi, moving on
and on to Bryn Bwa, and, finally, to some place or other in the lower
part of Dyfed. Like the soldiers of our earthly world, they were
possessed of terribly fascinating music; and in the autumnal season
they had their rings, still named from them, in which they sang and
danced. The young man of &#7930;ech y Derwy&#273;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e8575src" href="#xd25e8575" name="xd25e8575src">24</a> was his
father&rsquo;s only son, as well as heir to the farm; so he was very
dear to his father and his mother, indeed he was the light of their
eyes. Now, the head servant and the son were bosom friends: they were
like brothers together, or rather twin brothers. As the son and the
servant were such friends, the farmer&rsquo;s wife used to get exactly
the same kind of clothes prepared for the servant as for her son. The
two fell in love with two handsome young women of very good reputation
in the neighbourhood. The two couples were soon joined in honest
wedlock, and great was the merry-making on the occasion. The servant
had a suitable place to live in on the farm of &#7930;ech y
Derwy&#273;; but about half a year after the son&rsquo;s marriage,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb153" href="#pb153" name=
"pb153">153</a>]</span>he and his friend went out for sport, when the
servant withdrew to a wild and retired corner to look for game. He
returned presently for his friend, but when he got there he could not
see him anywhere: he kept looking around for some time for him,
shouting and whistling, but there was no sign of his friend. By-and-by,
he went home to &#7930;ech y Derwy&#273; expecting to see him, but no
one knew anything about him. Great was the sorrow of his family through
the night; and next day the anxiety was still greater. They went to see
the place where his friend had seen him last: it was hard to tell
whether his mother or his wife wept the more bitterly; but the father
was a little better, though he also looked as if he were half mad with
grief. The spot was examined, and, to their surprise, they saw a fairy
ring close by, and the servant recollected that he had heard the sound
of very fascinating music somewhere or other about the time in
question. It was at once agreed that the man had been unfortunate
enough to have got into the ring of the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth</i>, and
to have been carried away by them, nobody knew whither. Weeks and
months passed away, and a son was born to the heir of &#7930;ech y
Derwy&#273;, but the young father was not there to see his child, which
the old people thought very hard. However, the little one grew up the
very picture of his father, and great was his influence over his
grandfather and grandmother; in fact he was everything to them. He grew
up to be a man, and he married a good-looking girl in that
neighbourhood; but her family did not enjoy the reputation of being
kind-hearted people. The old folks died, and their daughter-in-law
also. One windy afternoon in the month of October, the family of
&#7930;ech y Derwy&#273; beheld a tall thin old man, with his beard and
hair white as snow, coming towards the house, and they thought he was
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb154" href="#pb154" name=
"pb154">154</a>]</span>a Jew. The servant maids stared at him, and
their mistress laughed at the &ldquo;old Jew,&rdquo; at the same time
that she lifted the children up one after another to see him. He came
to the door and entered boldly enough, asking about his parents. The
mistress answered him in an unusually surly and contemptuous tone,
wondering why the &ldquo;drunken old Jew had come there,&rdquo; because
it was thought he had been drinking, and that he would otherwise not
have spoken so. The old man cast wondering and anxious looks around on
everything in the house, feeling as he did greatly surprised; but it
was the little children about the floor that drew his attention most:
his looks were full of disappointment and sorrow. He related the whole
of his account, saying that he had been out the day before and that he
was now returning. The mistress of the house told him that she had
heard a tale about her husband&rsquo;s father, that he had been lost
years before her birth while out sporting, whilst her father maintained
that it was not true, but that he had been killed. She became angry,
and quite lost her temper at seeing &ldquo;the old Jew&rdquo; not going
away. The old man was roused, saying that he was the owner of the
house, and that he must have his rights. He then went out to see his
possessions, and presently went to the house of the servant, where, to
his surprise, things had greatly changed; after conversing with an aged
man, who sat by the fire, the one began to scrutinize the other more
and more. The aged man by the fire told him what had been the fate of
his old friend, the heir of &#7930;ech y Derwy&#273;. They talked
deliberately of the events of their youth, but it all seemed like a
dream; in short, the old man in the corner concluded that his visitor
was his old friend, the heir of &#7930;ech y Derwy&#273;, returning
from the land of the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth Teg</i> after spending half a
hundred years there. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb155" href="#pb155"
name="pb155">155</a>]</span>The other old man, with the snow-white
beard, believed in his history, and much did they talk together and
question one another for many hours. The old man by the fire said that
the master of &#7930;ech y Derwy&#273; was away from home that day, and
he induced his aged visitor to eat some food, but, to the horror of
all, the eater fell down dead on the spot<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e8597src" href="#xd25e8597" name="xd25e8597src">25</a>. There is
no record that an inquest was held over him, but the tale relates that
the cause of it was, that he ate food after having been so long in the
world of the fair family. His old friend insisted on seeing him buried
by the side of his ancestors; but the rudeness of the mistress of
&#7930;ech y Derwy&#273; to her father-in-law brought a curse on the
family that clung to it to distant generations, and until the place had
been sold nine times.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A tale like this is to be found related of Idwal of Nantclwyd, in
<i lang="cy">Cymru Fu</i>, p. 85. I said &lsquo;a tale like
this,&rsquo; but, on reconsidering the matter, I should think it is the
very same tale passed through the hands of Glasynys or some one of his
imitators. Another of this kind will be found in the <i lang=
"cy">Brython</i>, ii. 170, and several similar ones also in Wirt
Sikes&rsquo; book, pp. 65&ndash;90, either given at length, or merely
referred to. There is one kind of variant which deserves special
notice, as making the music to which the sojourner in Faery listens for
scores of years to be that of a bird singing on a tree. A story of the
sort is located by Howells, in his <i>Cambrian Superstitions</i>, pp.
127&ndash;8, at Pant Shon Shencin, near Pencader, in Cardiganshire.
This latter kind of story leads easily up to another development,
namely, to substituting for the bird&rsquo;s warble the song and
felicity of heaven, and for the simple shepherd a pious monk. In
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb156" href="#pb156" name=
"pb156">156</a>]</span>this form it is located at a place called
&#7930;wyn y Nef, or &lsquo;Heaven&rsquo;s Grove,&rsquo; near Celynnog
Fawr, in Carnarvonshire. It is given by Glasynys in <i lang="cy">Cymru
Fu</i>, pp. 183&ndash;4, where it was copied from the <i lang=
"cy">Brython</i>, iii. 111, in which he had previously published it.
Several versions of it in rhyme came down from the eighteenth century,
and Silvan Evans has brought together twenty-six stanzas in point in
<i>St. David&rsquo;s College Magazine</i> for 1881, pp. 191&ndash;200,
where he has put into a few paragraphs all that is known about the song
of the <i lang="cy">Hen Wr o&rsquo;r Coed</i>, or the Old Man of the
Wood, in his usually clear and lucid style.</p>
<p>A tale from the other end of the tract of country once occupied by a
sprinkling, perhaps, of Celts among a population of Picts, makes the
man, and not the fairies, supply the music. I owe it to the kindness of
the Rev. Andrew Clark, Fellow of Lincoln College, Oxford, who heard it
from the late sexton of the parish of Dollar, in the county of
Clackmannan. The sexton died some twelve years ago, aged seventy: he
had learnt the tale from his father. The following are Mr.
Clark&rsquo;s words:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Glendevon is a parish and village in the Ochils in County
Perth, about five miles from Dollar as you come up Glen Queich and down
by Gloomhill. Glen Queich is a narrowish glen between two grassy
hills&mdash;at the top of the glen is a round hill of no great height,
but very neat shape, the grass of which is always short and trim, and
the ferns on the shoulder of a very marked green. This, as you come up
the glen, seems entirely to block the way. It is called the
&ldquo;Maiden Castle.&rdquo; Only when you come quite close do you see
the path winding round the foot of it. A little further on is a fine
spring bordered with flat stones, in the middle of a neat, turfy spot,
called the &ldquo;Maiden&rsquo;s Well.&rdquo; This road, till the new
toll-road was made on the other side <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb157" href="#pb157" name="pb157">157</a>]</span>of the hills, was the
thoroughfare between Dollar and Glendevon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The following is the legend, as told by the
&lsquo;Bethrel&rsquo;:&mdash;&lsquo;A piper, carrying his pipes, was
coming from Glendevon to Dollar in the grey of the evening. He crossed
the Garchel (a little stream running into the Queich burn), and looked
at the &ldquo;Maiden Castle,&rdquo; and saw only the grey hillside and
heard only the wind soughing through the bent. He had got beyond it
when he heard a burst of lively music: he turned round, and instead of
the dark knoll saw a great castle, with lights blazing from the
windows, and heard the noise of dancing issuing from the open door. He
went back incautiously, and a procession issuing forth at that moment,
he was caught and taken into a great hall ablaze with lights, and
people dancing on the floor. He had to pipe to them for a day or two,
but he got anxious, because he knew his people would be wondering why
he did not come back in the morning as he had promised. The fairies
seemed to sympathize with his anxiety, and promised to let him go if he
played a favourite tune of his, which they seemed fond of, to their
satisfaction. He played his very best, the dance went fast and furious,
and at its close he was greeted with loud applause. On his release he
found himself alone, in the grey of the evening, beside the dark
hillock, and no sound was heard save the purr of the burn and the
soughing of the wind through the bent. Instead of completing his
journey to Dollar, he walked hastily back to Glendevon to relieve his
folk&rsquo;s anxiety. He entered his father&rsquo;s house and found no
kent face there. On his protesting that he had gone only a day or two
before, and waxing loud in his bewildered talk, a grey old man was
roused from a doze behind the fire; and told how he had heard when a
boy from his father that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb158" href=
"#pb158" name="pb158">158</a>]</span>a piper had gone away to Dollar on
a quiet evening, and had never been heard or seen since, nor any trace
of him found. He had been in the &ldquo;castle&rdquo; for a hundred
years.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The term <i lang="cy">Plant Rhys &#272;wfn</i> has already been
brought before the reader: it means &lsquo;the Children of <i lang=
"cy">Rhys &#272;wfn</i>,&rsquo; and <i lang="cy">Rhys &#272;wfn</i>
means literally Rhys the Deep, but the adjective in Welsh connotes
depth of character in the sense of shrewdness or cunning. Nay, even the
English <i>deep</i> is often borrowed for use in the same sense, as
when one colloquially says <i lang="cy">un d&icirc;p iawn yw e</i>,
&lsquo;he is a very calculating or cunning fellow.&rsquo; The following
account of Rhys and his progeny is given by Gwyniony&#273; in the first
volume of the <i lang="cy">Brython</i>, p. 130, which deserves being
cited at length:&mdash;&lsquo;There is a tale current in Dyfed, that
there is, or rather that there has been, a country between Cemmes, the
northern Hundred of Pembrokeshire, and Aberdaron in &#7930;eyn. The
chief patriarch of the inhabitants was Rhys &#272;wfn, and his
descendants used to be called after him the Children of Rhys &#272;wfn.
They were, it is said, a handsome race enough, but remarkably small in
size. It is stated that certain herbs of a strange nature grew in their
land, so that they were able to keep their country from being seen by
even the most sharp sighted of invaders. There is no account that these
remarkable herbs grew in any other part of the world excepting on a
small spot, about a square yard in area, in a certain part of Cemmes.
If it chanced that a man stood alone on it, he beheld the whole of the
territory of <i lang="cy">Plant Rhys &#272;wfn</i>; but the moment he
moved he would lose sight of it altogether, and it would have been
utterly vain for him to look for his footprints. In another story, as
will be seen presently, the requisite platform was a turf from St.
David&rsquo;s churchyard. The Rhysians had not much land&mdash;they
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb159" href="#pb159" name=
"pb159">159</a>]</span>lived in towns. So they were wont in former
times to come to market to Cardigan, and to raise the prices of things
terribly. They were seen of no one coming or going, but only seen there
in the market. When prices happened to be high, and the corn all sold,
however much there might have been there in the morning, the poor used
to say to one another on the way home, &ldquo;Oh! <i>they</i> were
there to-day,&rdquo; meaning <i lang="cy">Plant Rhys &#272;wfn</i>. So
they were dear friends in the estimation of Si&ocirc;n Phil Hywel, the
farmer; but not so high in the opinion of Dafy&#273;, the labourer. It
is said, however, that they were very honest and resolute men. A
certain Gruffy&#273; ab Einon was wont to sell them more corn than
anybody else, and so he was a great friend of theirs. He was honoured
by them beyond all his contemporaries by being led on a visit to their
home. As they were great traders like the Ph&oelig;nicians of old, they
had treasures from all countries under the sun. Gruffy&#273;, after
feasting his eyes to satiety on their wonders, was led back by them
loaded with presents. But before taking leave of them, he asked them
how they succeeded in keeping themselves safe from invaders, as one of
their number might become unfaithful, and go beyond the virtue of the
herbs that formed their safety. &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; replied the little
old man of shrewd looks, &ldquo;just as Ireland has been blessed with a
soil on which venomous reptiles cannot live, so with our land: no
traitor can live here. Look at the sand on the sea-shore: perfect unity
prevails there, and so among us. Rhys, the father of our race, bade us,
even to the most distant descendant, honour our parents and ancestors;
love our own wives without looking at those of our neighbours; and do
our best for our children and grandchildren. And he said that if we did
so, no one of us would ever prove unfaithful to another, or
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb160" href="#pb160" name=
"pb160">160</a>]</span>become what you call a traitor. The latter is a
wholly imaginary character among us; strange pictures are drawn of him
with his feet like those of an ass, with a nest of snakes in his bosom,
with a head like the devil&rsquo;s, with hands somewhat like a
man&rsquo;s, while one of them holds a large knife, and the family lies
dead around the figure. Good-bye!&rdquo; When Gruffy&#273; looked about
him he lost sight of the country of <i lang="cy">Plant Rhys</i>, and
found himself near his home. He became very wealthy after this, and
continued to be a great friend of <i lang="cy">Plant Rhys</i> as long
as he lived. After Gruffy&#273;&rsquo;s death they came to market
again, but such was the greed of the farmers, like Gruffy&#273; before
them, for riches, and so unreasonable were the prices they asked for
their corn, that the Rhysians took offence and came no more to Cardigan
to market. The old people used to think that they now went to Fishguard
market, as very strange people were wont to be seen there.&rsquo; On
the other hand, some Fishguard people were lately of opinion that it
was at Haverfordwest the fairies did their marketing: I refer to a
letter of Mr. Ferrar Fenton&rsquo;s, in the <i>Pembroke County
Guardian</i> of October 31, 1896, in which he mentions a conversation
he had with a Fishguard woman as to the existence of fairies:
&lsquo;There are fairies,&rsquo; she asserted, &lsquo;for they came to
Ha&rsquo;rfordwest market to buy things, so there <i>must</i>
be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>With this should be compared pp. 9&ndash;10 of Wirt Sikes&rsquo;
<i>British Goblins</i>, where mention is made of sailors on the coast
of Pembrokeshire and Carmarthenshire, &lsquo;who still talk of the
green meadows of enchantment lying in the Irish Channel to the west of
Pembrokeshire,&rsquo; and of men who had landed on them, or seen them
suddenly vanishing. The author then proceeds to abstract from
Howells&rsquo; <i>Cambrian Superstitions</i>, p. 119, the following
paragraph:&mdash;&lsquo;The fairies inhabiting these <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb161" href="#pb161" name=
"pb161">161</a>]</span>islands are said to have regularly attended the
markets at Milford Haven and Laugharne. They made their purchases
without speaking, laid down their money and departed, always leaving
the exact sum required, which they seemed to know without asking the
price of anything. Sometimes they were invisible; but they were often
seen by sharp-eyed persons. There was always one special butcher at
Milford Haven upon whom the fairies bestowed their patronage instead of
distributing their favours indiscriminately. The Milford Haven folk
could see the green Fairy Islands distinctly, lying out a short
distance from land; and the general belief was that they were densely
peopled with fairies. It was also said that the latter went to and fro
between the islands and the shore, through a subterranean gallery under
the bottom of the sea.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Another tale given in the <i lang="cy">Brython</i>, ii. 20, by a
writer who gives his name as B. Davies<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e8698src" href="#xd25e8698" name="xd25e8698src">26</a>, will serve
to show, short though it be, that the term <i lang="cy">Plant Rhys
&#272;wfn</i> was not confined to those honestly dealing fairies, but
was used in a sense wholly synonymous with that of <i lang="cy">Tylwyth
Teg</i>, as understood in other parts of Wales. The story runs as
follows, and should be compared with the Dyffryn Mymbyr one given
above, pp. 100&ndash;3:&mdash;&lsquo;One calm hot day, when the sun of
heaven was brilliantly shining, and the hay in the dales was being
busily made by lads and lasses, and by grown-up people of both sexes, a
woman in the neighbourhood of Emlyn placed her one-year-old infant in
the <i lang="cy">gader</i>, or chair, as the cradle is called in these
parts, and out she went to the field for a while, intending to return,
when her <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb162" href="#pb162" name=
"pb162">162</a>]</span>neighbour, an old woman overtaken by the
decrepitude of eighty summers, should call to her that her darling was
crying. It was not long before she heard the old woman calling to her;
she ran hurriedly, and as soon as she set foot on the kitchen floor she
took her little one in her arms as usual, saying to him, &ldquo;O my
little one! thy mother&rsquo;s delight art thou! I would not take the
world for thee, &amp;c.&rdquo; But to her surprise he had a very old
look about him, and the more the tender-hearted mother gazed at his
face, the stranger it seemed to her, so that at last she placed him in
the cradle and told her trouble and sorrow to her relatives and
acquaintances. And after this one and the other had given his opinion,
it was agreed at last that it was one of <i lang="cy">Rhys
&#272;wfn&rsquo;s</i> children that was in the cradle, and not her
dearly loved baby. In this distress there was nothing to do but to
fetch a sorcerer, as fast as the fastest horse could gallop. He said,
when he saw the child, that he had seen his like before, and that it
would be a hard job to get rid of him, though not such a very hard job
this time. The shovel was made red hot in the fire by one of the
Cefnarth<a class="noteref" id="xd25e8716src" href="#xd25e8716" name=
"xd25e8716src">27</a> boys, and held before the child&rsquo;s face; and
in an instant the short little old man took to his heels, and neither
he nor his like was seen afterwards from Aber Cuch to Aber Bargoed at
any rate. The mother, it is said, found her darling unscathed the next
moment. I remember also hearing that the strange child was as old as
the grandfather of the one that had been lost.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As I see no reason to make any profound distinction between lake
maidens and sea maidens, I now give Gwyniony&#273;&rsquo;s account of
the mermaid who was found <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb163" href=
"#pb163" name="pb163">163</a>]</span>by a fisherman from
&#7930;andydoch or St. Dogmael&rsquo;s<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e8723src" href="#xd25e8723" name="xd25e8723src">28</a>, near
Cardigan: see the <i lang="cy">Brython</i>, i. 82:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;One fine afternoon in September, in the beginning of the last
century, a fisherman, whose name was Pergrin<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e8861src" href="#xd25e8861" name="xd25e8861src">29</a>, went to a
recess in the rock near Pen Cemmes, where he found a sea maiden doing
her hair, and he took the water lady prisoner to his
boat&#8202;&hellip;. We know not what language is used by sea maidens
&hellip; but this one, this time at any rate, talked, it is said, very
good Welsh; for when she was in despair in Pergrin&rsquo;s custody,
weeping copiously, and with her tresses all dishevelled, she called
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb164" href="#pb164" name=
"pb164">164</a>]</span>out: &lsquo;Pergrin, if thou wilt let me go, I
will give thee three shouts in the time of thy greatest need.&rsquo;
So, in wonder and fear, he let her go to walk the streets of the deep,
and visit her sweethearts there. Days and weeks passed without Pergrin
seeing her after this; but one hot afternoon, when the sea was pretty
calm, and the fishermen had no thought of danger, behold his old
acquaintance showing her head and locks, and shouting out in a loud
voice: &lsquo;Pergrin! Pergrin! Pergrin! take up thy nets, take up thy
nets, take up thy nets!&rsquo; Pergrin and his companion instantly
obeyed the message, and drew their nets in with great haste. In they
went, past the bar, and by the time they had reached the Pwll Cam the
most terrible storm had overspread the sea, while he and his companion
were safe on land. Twice nine others had gone out with them, but they
were all drowned without having the chance of obeying the warning of
the water lady.&rsquo; Perhaps it is not quite irrelevant to mention
here the armorial bearings which Drayton ascribes to the neighbouring
county of Cardigan in the following couplet in his <i>Battaile of
Agincourt</i> (London, 1631), p. 23:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">As Cardigan the next to them that went,</p>
<p class="line">Came with a Mermayd sitting on a Rock.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">A writer in the <i lang="cy">Brython</i>, iv. 194,
states that the people of Nefyn in &#7930;eyn claim the story of the
fisher and the mermaid as belonging to them, which proves that a
similar legend has been current there: add to this the fact mentioned
in the <i lang="cy">Brython</i>, iii. 133, that a red mermaid with
yellow hair, on a white field, figures in the coat of arms of the
family resident at Glasfryn in the parish of &#7930;angybi, in
Eifiony&#273; or the southern portion of Carnarvonshire; and we have
already suggested that Glasynys&rsquo; story (pp. 117&ndash;25) was
made <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb165" href="#pb165" name=
"pb165">165</a>]</span>up, to a certain extent, of materials found on
the coasts of Carnarvonshire. A small batch of stories about South
Wales mermaids is given by a writer who calls himself Ab Nadol<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e8890src" href="#xd25e8890" name=
"xd25e8890src">30</a>, in the <i lang="cy">Brython</i>, iv. 310, as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A few rockmen are said to have been working, about eighty
years ago, in a quarry near Porth y Rhaw, when the day was calm and
clear, with nature, as it were, feasting, the flowers shedding sweet
scent around, and the hot sunshine beaming into the jagged rocks.
Though an occasional wave rose to strike the romantic cliffs, the sea
was like a placid lake, with its light coverlet of blue attractive
enough to entice one of the ladies of <i lang="cy">Rhys &#272;wfn</i>
forth from the town seen by Daniel Huws off Trefin as he was journeying
between Fishguard and St. David&rsquo;s in the year 1858, to make her
way to the top of a stone and to sit on it to disentangle her flowing
silvery hair. Whilst she was cleaning herself, the rockmen went down,
and when they got near her they perceived that, from her waist upwards,
she was like the lasses of Wales, but that, from her waist downwards,
she had the body of a fish. And, when they began to talk to her, they
found she spoke Welsh, though she only uttered the following few words
to them: &ldquo;Reaping in Pembrokeshire and weeding in
Carmarthenshire.&rdquo; Off she then went to walk in the depth of the
sea towards her home. Another tale is repeated about a mermaid, said to
have been caught by men below the land of &#7930;anwnda, near the spot,
if not on the spot, where the French made their landing afterwards, and
three miles to the west of Fishguard. It then goes on to say that they
carried her to their home, and kept her in a secure place for
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb166" href="#pb166" name=
"pb166">166</a>]</span>some time; before long, she begged to be allowed
to return to the brine land, and gave the people of the house three
bits of advice; but I only remember one of them,&rsquo; he writes,
&lsquo;and this is it: &ldquo;Skim the surface of the pottage before
adding sweet milk to it: it will be whiter and sweeter, and less of it
will do.&rdquo; I was told that this family follow the three advices to
this day.&rsquo; A somewhat similar advice to that about the pottage is
said to have been given by a mermaid, under similar circumstances, to a
Manxman.</p>
<p>After putting the foregoing bits together, I was favoured by Mr.
Benjamin Williams with notes on the tales and on the persons from whom
he heard them: they form the contents of two or three letters, mostly
answers to queries of mine, and the following is the substance of
them:&mdash;Mr. Williams is a native of the valley of Troed yr
Aur<a class="noteref" id="xd25e8905src" href="#xd25e8905" name=
"xd25e8905src">31</a>, in the Cardiganshire parish of that name. He
spent a part of his youth at Verwig, in the angle between the northern
bank of the Teifi and Cardigan Bay. He heard of Rhys &#272;wfn&rsquo;s
Children first from a distant relative of his father&rsquo;s, a
Catherine Thomas, who came to visit her daughter, who lived not far
from his father&rsquo;s house: that would now be from forty-eight to
fifty years ago. He was very young at the time, and of Rhys
&#272;wfn&rsquo;s progeny he formed a wonderful idea, which was partly
due also to the talk of one James Davies or Si&agrave;ms Mocyn, who was
very well up in folklore, and was one of his father&rsquo;s next-door
neighbours. He was an old man, and nephew to the musician, David
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb167" href="#pb167" name=
"pb167">167</a>]</span>Jenkin Morgan. The only spot near Mr.
Williams&rsquo; home, that used to be frequented by the fairies, was
Cefn y Ceirw, &lsquo;the Stag&rsquo;s Ridge,&rsquo; a large farm, so
called from having been kept as a park for their deer by the Lewises of
Aber Nant Bychan. He adds that the late Mr. Philipps, of Aberglasney,
was very fond of talking of things in his native neighbourhood, and of
mentioning the fairies at Cefn y Ceirw. It was after moving to Verwig
that Mr. Williams began to put the tales he heard on paper: then he
came in contact with three brothers, whose names were John, Owen, and
Thomas Evans. They were well-to-do and respectable bachelors, living
together on the large farm of Hafod Ruffy&#273;. Thomas was a man of
very strong common sense, and worth consulting on any subject: he was a
good arithmetician, and a constant reader of the Baptist periodical,
<i lang="cy">Seren Gomer</i>, from its first appearance. He thoroughly
understood the bardic metres, and had a fair knowledge of music. He was
well versed in Scripture, and filled the office of deacon at the
Baptist Chapel. His death took place in the year 1864. Now, the eldest
of the three brothers, the one named John, or Si&ocirc;n, was then
about seventy-five years of age, and he thoroughly believed in the
tales about the fairies, as will be seen from the following short
dialogue:&mdash;</p>
<p>Si&ocirc;n: <i lang="cy">Williams bach, ma&rsquo;n rhaid i bod
nhw&rsquo;i g&acirc;l: yr w i&rsquo;n cofio yn amser Bone fod marchnad

si&oacute;wmin yna yn ge&#7931;i gneid pob tric.</i></p>
<p><i>John</i>: &lsquo;My dear Williams, it must be that they exist: I
remember Cardigan market, in the time of Bonaparte, full of corn in the
morning&mdash;enough for a month&mdash;but in less than half an hour it
was all gone. It was impossible to see them: they have as much money as
they like.&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>Williams</i>: &lsquo;How is it, then, that men did not see them,
John?&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>John</i>: &lsquo;Oh, they have men like us to do the buying for
them; and they can, like those old showmen, do every kind of
trick.&rsquo;</p>
<p>At this kind of display of simplicity on the part of his brother,
Thomas used to smile and say: &lsquo;My brother John believes such
things as those;&rsquo; for he had no belief in them himself. Still it
is from his mouth that Mr. Williams published the tales in the <i lang=
"cy">Brython</i>, which have been reproduced here, that of
&lsquo;Pergrin and the Mermaid,&rsquo; and all about the &lsquo;Heir of
&#7930;ech y Derwy&#273;,&rsquo; not to mention the ethical element in
the account of Rhys &#272;wfn&rsquo;s country and its people, the
product probably of his mind. Thomas Evans, or as he was really called,
Tommos Ifan, was given rather to grappling with the question of the
origin of such beliefs; so one day he called Mr. Williams out, and led
him to a spot about four hundred yards from Bol y Fron, where the
latter then lived: he pointed to the setting sun, and asked Mr.
Williams what he thought of the glorious sunset before them. &lsquo;It
is all produced,&rsquo; he then observed, &lsquo;by the reflection of
the sun&rsquo;s rays on the mist: one might think,&rsquo; he went on to
say, &lsquo;that there was there a paradise of a country full of
fields, forests, and everything that is desirable.&rsquo; And before
they had moved away the grand scene had disappeared, when <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb169" href="#pb169" name=
"pb169">169</a>]</span>Thomas suggested that the idea of the existence
of the country of Rhys &#272;wfn&rsquo;s Children arose from the
contemplation of that phenomenon. One may say that Thomas Evans was
probably far ahead of the Welsh historians who try to extract history
from the story of <i lang="cy">Cantre&rsquo;r Gwaelod</i>, &lsquo;the
Bottom Hundred,&rsquo; beneath the waves of Cardigan Bay; but what was
seen was probably an instance of the mirage to be mentioned presently.
Lastly, besides Mr. Williams&rsquo; contributions to the <i lang=
"cy">Brython</i>, and a small volume of poetry, entitled <i lang=
"cy">Bria&#7931;en glan Ceri</i>, some tales of his were published by
&#7930;a&#7931;awg in <i>Bygones</i> some years ago, and he had the
prize at the Cardigan Eiste&#273;fod of 1866 for the best collection in
Welsh of the folklore of Dyfed: his recollection was that it contained
in all thirty-six tales of all kinds; but since the manuscript, as the
property of the Committee of that Eiste&#273;fod, was sold, he could
not now consult it: in fact he is not certain as to who the owner of it
may now be, though he has an idea that it is either the Rev. Rees
Williams, vicar of Whitchurch, near Solva, Pembrokeshire, or R. D.
Jenkins, Esq., of Cilbronnau, Cardiganshire. Whoever the owner may be,
he would probably be only too glad to have it published, and I mention
this merely to call attention to it. The Eiste&#273;fod is to be
commended for encouraging local research, and sometimes even for
burying the results in obscurity, but not always.</p>

<p class="first">Before leaving Dyfed I wish to revert to the extract
from Mr. Sikes, p. 161 above. He had been helped partly by the article
on Gavran, in the <i>Cambrian Biography</i>, by William Owen, better
known since as William Owen Pughe and Dr. Pughe, and partly by a note

with the virtue of a blade of grass, by the brief mention of &#7930;yn
Ir&#273;yn above, p. 148:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of these Islands, or Green Spots of the Floods, there are
some singular superstitions. They are the abode of the <i lang=
"cy">Tylwyth Teg</i>, or the fair family, the souls of the virtuous
Druids, who, not having been Christians, cannot enter the Christian
heaven, but enjoy this heaven of their own. They however discover a
love of mischief, neither becoming happy spirits, nor consistent with
their original character; for they love to visit the earth, and,
seizing a man, inquire whether he will travel above wind, mid wind, or
below wind; above wind is a giddy and terrible passage, below wind is
through bush and brake, the middle is a safe course. But the spell of
security is, to catch hold of the grass, for these Beings have not
power to destroy a blade of grass. In their better moods they come over
and carry the Welsh in their boats. He who visits these Islands
imagines on his return that he has been absent only a few hours, when,
in truth, whole centuries have passed away. If you take a turf from St.
David&rsquo;s churchyard, and stand upon it on the sea shore, you
behold these Islands. A <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb171" href=
"#pb171" name="pb171">171</a>]</span>man once, who thus obtained sight
of them, immediately put to sea to find them; but they disappeared, and
his search was in vain. He returned, looked at them again from the
enchanted turf, again set sail, and failed again. The third time he
took the turf into his vessel, and stood upon it till he reached
them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A correspondent signing himself &lsquo;the Antient Mariner,&rsquo;
and writing, in the <i>Pembroke County Guardian</i>, from Newport,
Pembrokeshire, Oct. 26, 1896, cites Southey&rsquo;s notes, and adds to
them the statement, that some fifty years ago there was a tradition
amongst the inhabitants of Trevine (Trefin) in his county, that these
Islands could be seen from &#7930;an Non, or Eglwys Non, in that
neighbourhood. To return to <i lang="cy">Madoc</i>, Southey adds to the
note already quoted a reference to the inhabitants of Arran More, on
the coast of Galway, to the effect that they think that they can on a
clear day see Hy-Breasail, the Enchanted Island supposed to be the
Paradise of the Pagan Irish: compare the Phantom City seen in the same
sea from the coast of Clare. Then he asks a question suggestive of the
explanation, that all this is due to &lsquo;that very extraordinary
phenomenon, known in Sicily by the name of Morgaine le Fay&rsquo;s
works.&rsquo; In connexion with this question of mirage I venture to
quote again from the <i>Pembroke County Guardian</i>. Mr. Ferrar
Fenton, already mentioned, writes in the issue of Nov. 1, 1896, giving
a report which he had received one summer morning from Captain John
Evans, since deceased. It is to the effect &lsquo;that once when
trending up the Channel, and passing Grasholm Island, in what he had
always known as deep water, he was surprised to see to windward of him
a large tract of land covered with a beautiful green meadow. It was
not, however, <i>above water</i>, but just a few feet <i>below</i>, say
two or three, so that the grass waved and swam about <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb172" href="#pb172" name="pb172">172</a>]</span>as
the ripple flowed over it, in a most delightful way to the eye, so that
as watched it made one feel quite drowsy. You know, he continued, I
have heard old people say there is a floating island off there, that
sometimes rises to the surface, or nearly, and then sinks down again
fathoms deep, so that no one sees it for years, and when nobody expects
it comes up again for a while. How it may be, I do not know, but that
is what they say.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lastly, Mr. E. Perkins, of Penysgwarne, near Fishguard, wrote on
Nov. 2, 1896, as follows, of a changing view to be had from the top of
the Garn, which means the <i lang="cy">Garn Fawr</i>, one of the most
interesting prehistoric sites in the county, and one I have had the
pleasure of visiting more than once in the company of Henry Owen and
Edward Laws, the historians of Pembrokeshire:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;May not the fairy islands referred to by Professor Rhys have
originated from mirages? During the glorious weather we enjoyed last
summer, I went up one particularly fine evening to the top of the Garn
behind Penysgwarne to view the sunset. It would have been worth a
thousand miles&rsquo; travel to go to see such a scene as I saw that
evening. It was about half an hour before sunset&mdash;the bay was calm
and smooth as the finest mirror. The rays of the sun made</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">A golden path across the sea,</p>
</div>
<p class="first">and a picture indescribable. As the sun neared the
horizon the rays broadened until the sheen resembled a gigantic golden
plate prepared to hold the brighter sun. No sooner had the sun set than
I saw a striking mirage. To the right I saw a stretch of country
similar to a landscape in this country. A farmhouse and out-buildings
were seen, I will not say quite as distinct as I can see the upper part
of St. David&rsquo;s parish from this Garn, but much more detailed. We
could see fences, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb173" href="#pb173"
name="pb173">173</a>]</span>roads, and gateways leading to the
farmyard, but in the haze it looked more like a panoramic view than a
veritable landscape. Similar mirages may possibly have caused our old
<i lang="cy">tadau</i> to think these were the abode of the
fairies.&rsquo;</p>
<p>To return to Mr. Sikes, the rest of his account of the Pembrokeshire
fairies and their green islands, of their Milford butcher, and of the
subterranean gallery leading into their home, comes, as already
indicated, for the most part from Howells. But it does not appear on
what authority Southey himself made departed druids of the fairies. One
would be glad to be reassured on this last point, as such a hypothesis
would fit in well enough with what we are told of the sacrosanct
character of the inhabitants of the isles on the coast of Britain in
ancient times. Take, for instance, the brief account given by Plutarch
of one of the isles explored by a certain Demetrius in the service of
the Emperor of Rome: see chapter viii.</p>

<p class="first">Mr. Craigfryn Hughes, the author of a Welsh
novelette<a class="noteref" id="xd25e9060src" href="#xd25e9060" name=
"xd25e9060src">32</a> with its scene laid in Glamorgan, having induced
me to take a copy, I read it and found it full of local colouring. Then
I ventured to sound the author on the question of fairy tales, and the
reader will be able to judge how hearty the response has been. Before
reproducing the tale which Mr. Hughes has sent me, I will briefly put
into English his account of himself and his authorities. Mr. Hughes
lives at the Quakers&rsquo; Yard in the neighbourhood of
Pontypri&#273;, in Glamorganshire. His father was not a
believer<a class="noteref" id="xd25e9065src" href="#xd25e9065" name=
"xd25e9065src">33</a> in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb174" href=
"#pb174" name="pb174">174</a>]</span>tales about fairies or the like,
and he learned all he knows of the traditions about them in his
father&rsquo;s absence, from his grandmother and other old people. The
old lady&rsquo;s name was Rachel Hughes. She was born at Pandy Pont y
Cymmer, near Pontypool, or <i lang="cy">Pont ap Hywel</i> as Mr. Hughes
analyses the name, in the year 1773, and she had a vivid recollection
of Edmund Jones of the Tranch, of whom more anon, coming from time to
time to preach to the Independents there. She came, however, to live in
the parish of &#7930;anfabon, near the Quakers&rsquo; Yard, when she
was only twelve years of age; and there she continued to live to the
day of her death, which took place in 1864, so that she was about
ninety-one years of age at the time. Mr. Hughes adds that he remembers
many of the old inhabitants besides his grandmother, who were perfectly
familiar with the story he has put on record; but only two of them were
alive when he wrote to me in 1881, and these were both over ninety
years old, with their minds overtaken by the childishness of age; but
it was only a short time since the death of another, who was, as he
says, a walking library of tales about corpse candles, ghosts, and
<i lang="cy">Bendith y Mamau</i><a class="noteref" id="xd25e9077src"
href="#xd25e9077" name="xd25e9077src">34</a>, or &lsquo;The
Mothers&rsquo; Blessing,&rsquo; as the fairies are usually called in
Glamorgan. Mr. Hughes&rsquo; father tried to prevent his children being
taught any tales about ghosts, corpse <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb175" href="#pb175" name="pb175">175</a>]</span>candles, or fairies;
but the grandmother found opportunities of telling them plenty, and Mr.
Hughes vividly describes the effect on his mind when he was a boy, how
frightened he used to feel, how he pulled the clothes over his head in
bed, and how he half suffocated himself thereby under the effects of
the fear with which the tales used to fill him. Then, as to the
locality, he makes the following remarks:&mdash;&lsquo;There are few
people who have not heard something or other about the old graveyard of
the Quakers, which was made by Lydia Phil, a lady who lived at a
neighbouring farm house, called Cefn y Fforest. This old graveyard lies
in the eastern corner of the parish of Merthyr Tydfil, on land called
Pantannas, as to the meaning of which there is much controversy. Some
will have it that it is properly Pant yr Aros, or the Hollow of the
Staying, because travellers were sometimes stopped there overnight by
the swelling of the neighbouring river; others treat it as Pant yr
Hanes, the Hollow of the Legend, in allusion to the following story.
But before the graveyard was made, the spot was called Rhyd y Grug, or
the Ford of the Heather, which grows thereabouts in abundance. In front
of the old graveyard towards the south the rivers Taff and Bargoed,
which some would make into Byrgoed or Short-Wood, meet with each other,
and thence rush in one over terrible cliffs of rock, in the recesses of
which lie huge <i lang="cy">cerwyni</i> or cauldron-like pools, called
respectively the Gerwyn Fach, the Gerwyn Fawr, and the Gerwyn Ganol,
where many a drowning has taken place. As one walks up over Tarren y
Crynwyr, &ldquo;the Quakers&rsquo; Rift,&rdquo; until Pantannas is
reached, and proceeds northwards for about a mile and a half, one
arrives at a farm house called Pen Craig Daf<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e9095src" href="#xd25e9095" name="xd25e9095src">35</a>, &ldquo;the
Top of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb176" href="#pb176" name=
"pb176">176</a>]</span>Taff Rock.&rdquo; The path between the two
houses leads through fertile fields, in which may be seen, if one has
eyes to observe, small rings which are greener than the rest of the
ground. They are, in fact, green even as compared with the greenness
around them&mdash;these are the rings in which <i lang="cy">Bendith y
Mamau</i> used to meet to sing and dance all night. If a man happened
to get inside one of these circles when the fairies were there, he
could not be got out in a hurry, as they would charm him and lead him
into some of their caves, where they would keep him for ages, unawares
to him, listening to their music. The rings vary greatly in size, but
in point of form they are all round or oval. I have heard my
grandmother,&rsquo; says Mr. Hughes, &lsquo;reciting and singing
several of the songs which the fairies sang in these rings. One of them
began thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;In one of the centuries gone by, there lived a husbandman on
the farm of Pantannas; and at that time the fairies used to pay
frequent visits to several of the fields which belonged to him. He
cherished in his bosom a considerable hatred for the &ldquo;noisy,
boisterous, and pernicious tribe,&rdquo; as he called them, and often
did he long to be able to discover some way to rid the place of them.
At last he was told by an old witch that the way to get rid of them was
easy enough, and that she would tell him how to attain what he so
greatly wished, if he gave her one evening&rsquo;s milking<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e9410src" href="#xd25e9410" name=
"xd25e9410src">37</a> on his farm, and one morning&rsquo;s. He agreed
to her conditions, and from her he received advice, which was to the
effect that he was to plough all the fields where they had their
favourite resorts, and that, if they found the green sward gone, they
would take offence, and never return to trouble him with their visits
to the spot.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The husbandman followed the advice to the letter, and his
work was crowned with success. Not a single one of them was now to be
seen about the fields, and, instead of the sound of their sweet music,
which used to be always heard rising from the Coarse Meadow Land, the
most complete silence now reigned over their favourite resort.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He sowed his land with wheat and other grain; the verdant
spring had now thrust winter off its throne, and the fields appeared
splendid in their vernal and green livery.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But one evening, when the sun had retired to the chambers of
the west, and when the farmer of Pantannas <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb185" href="#pb185" name="pb185">185</a>]</span>was
returning home, he was met by a diminutive being in the shape of a man,
with a red coat on. When he had come right up to him, he unsheathed his
little sword, and, directing the point towards the farmer, he
said:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Vengeance cometh,</p>
<p class="line">Fast it approacheth.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">&lsquo;The farmer tried to laugh, but there was
something in the surly and stern looks of the little fellow which made
him feel exceedingly uncomfortable.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A few nights afterwards, as the family were retiring to rest,
they were very greatly frightened by a noise, as though the house was
falling to pieces; and, immediately after the noise, they heard a voice
uttering loudly the threatening words&mdash;and nothing
more:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Vengeance cometh.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">&lsquo;When, however, the corn was reaped and ready to
be carried to the barn, it was, all of a sudden, burnt up one night, so
that neither an ear nor a straw of it could be found anywhere in the
fields; and now nobody could have set the corn on fire but the
fairies.</p>
<p>&lsquo;As one may naturally suppose, the farmer felt very much on
account of this event, and he regretted in his heart having done
according to the witch&rsquo;s direction, and having thereby brought
upon him the anger and hatred of the fairies.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The day after the night of the burning of the corn, as he was
surveying the destruction caused by the fire, behold the little fellow,
who had met him a few days before, met him again, and, with a
challenging glance, he pointed his sword towards him,
saying:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">It but beginneth.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The farmer&rsquo;s face turned as white as marble, and
he stood calling the little fellow to come back; but the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb186" href="#pb186" name=
"pb186">186</a>]</span>dwarf proved very unyielding and reluctant to
turn to him; but, after long entreaty, he turned back, asking the
farmer, in a surly tone, what he wanted, when he was told by the latter
that he was quite willing to allow the fields, in which their favourite
resorts had been, to grow again into a green sward, and to let them
frequent them as often as they wished, provided they would no further
wreak their anger on him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&#8202;&ldquo;No,&rdquo; was the determined reply, &ldquo;the
word of the king has been given, that he will avenge himself on thee to
the utmost of his power; and there is no power on the face of creation
that will cause it to be withdrawn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The farmer began to weep at this, and, after a while, the
little fellow said that he would speak to his lord on the matter, and
that he would let him know the result, if he would come there to meet
him at the hour of sunset on the third day after.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The farmer promised to meet him; and, when the time appointed
for meeting the little man came, he found him awaiting him, and he was
told by him that his lord had seriously considered his request, but
that, as the king&rsquo;s word was ever immutable, the threatened
vengeance was to take effect on the family. On account, however, of his
repentance, it would not be allowed to happen in his time or that of
his children.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That calmed the disturbed mind of the farmer a good deal. The
fairies began again to pay frequent visits to the place, and their
melodious singing was again heard at night in the fields around.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>&lsquo;A century passed by without seeing the threatened vengeance
carried into effect; and, though the Pantannas family were reminded now
and again that it was certain <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb187"
href="#pb187" name="pb187">187</a>]</span>sooner or later to come,
nevertheless, by long hearing the voice that said&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Vengeance cometh,</p>
</div>
<p class="first">they became so accustomed to it, that they were ready
to believe that nothing would ever come of the threat.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The heir of Pantannas was paying his addresses to the
daughter of a neighbouring landowner who lived at the farm house called
Pen Craig Daf, and the wedding of the happy pair was to take place in a
few weeks, and the parents on both sides appeared exceedingly content
with the union that was about to take place between the two
families.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was Christmas time, and the intended wife paid a visit to
the family of her would-be husband. There they had a feast of roast
goose prepared for the occasion.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The company sat round the fire to relate amusing tales to
pass the time, when they were greatly frightened by a piercing voice,
rising, as it were, from the bed of the river<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e9473src" href="#xd25e9473" name="xd25e9473src">38</a>, and
shrieking:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">The time for revenge is come.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">&lsquo;They all went out to listen if they could hear
the voice a second time, but nothing was to be heard save the angry
noise of the water as it cascaded over the dread cliffs of the <i lang=
"cy">kerwyni</i>; they had not long, however, to wait till they heard
again the same voice rising above the noise of the waters, as they
boiled over the shoulders of the rock, and crying:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">The time is come.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">&lsquo;They could not guess what it meant, and so
great was their fright and astonishment, that no one could utter a word
to another. Shortly they returned to the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb188" href="#pb188" name="pb188">188</a>]</span>house, when they
believed that beyond doubt the building was being shaken to its
foundations by some noise outside. When all were thus paralysed by
fear, behold a little woman made her appearance on the table, which
stood near the window.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&#8202;&ldquo;What dost thou, ugly little thing, want
here?<span class="corr" id="xd25e9496" title=
"Source: &rsquo;">&rdquo;</span> asked one of those present.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&#8202;&ldquo;I have nothing to do with thee, O man of the
meddling tongue,&rdquo; said the little woman, &ldquo;but I have been
sent here to recount some things that are about to happen to this
family and another family in the neighbourhood, things that might be of
interest to them; but, as I have received such an insult from the black
fellow that sits in the corner, the veil that hides them from their
sight shall not be lifted by me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&#8202;&ldquo;Pray,&rdquo; said another of those present,
&ldquo;if thou hast in thy possession any knowledge with regard to the
future of any one of us that would interest us to hear, bring it
forth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&#8202;&ldquo;No, I will but merely tell you that a certain
maiden&rsquo;s heart is like a ship on the coast, unable to reach the
harbour because the pilot has lost heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;As soon as she had cried out the last word, she vanished, no
one knew whither or how.</p>
<p>&lsquo;During her visit, the cry rising from the river had stopped,
but soon afterwards it began again to proclaim:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">The time of vengeance is come;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">nor did it cease for a long while. The company had
been possessed by too much terror for one to be able to address
another, and a sheet of gloom had, as it were, been spread over the
face of each. The time for parting came, and Rhy&#273;erch the heir
went to escort Gwerfyl, his lady-love, home towards Pen Craig Daf, a
journey from which he never returned. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb189" href="#pb189" name="pb189">189</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;Before bidding one another &ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; they are
said to have sworn to each other eternal fidelity, even though they
should never see one another from that moment forth, and that nothing
should make the one forget the other.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is thought probable that the young man Rhy&#273;erch, on
his way back towards home, got into one of the rings of the fairies,
that they allured him into one of their caves in the Ravens&rsquo;
Rift, and that there he remained.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>&lsquo;It is high time for us now to turn back towards Pantannas and
Pen Craig Daf. The parents of the unlucky youth were almost beside
themselves: they had no idea where to go to look for him, and, though
they searched every spot in the place, they failed completely to find
him or any clue to his history.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A little higher up the country, there dwelt, in a cave
underground, an aged hermit called Gweiry&#273;, who was regarded also
as a sorcerer. They went a few weeks afterwards to ask him whether he
could give them any information about their lost son; but it was of
little avail. What that man told them did but deepen the wound and give
the event a still more hopeless aspect. When they had told him of the
appearance of the little woman, and the doleful cry heard rising from
the river on the night when their son was lost, he informed them that
it was the judgement threatened to the family by the fairies that had
overtaken the youth, and that it was useless for them to think of ever
seeing him again: possibly he might make his appearance after
generations had gone by, but not in their lifetime.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Time rolled on, weeks grew into months, and months into
years, until Rhy&#273;erch&rsquo;s father and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb190" href="#pb190" name=
"pb190">190</a>]</span>mother were gathered to their ancestors. The
place continued the same, but the inhabitants constantly changed, so
that the memory of Rhy&#273;erch&rsquo;s disappearance was fast dying
away. Nevertheless there was one who expected his return all the while,
and hoped, as it were against hope, to see him once more. Every morn,
as the gates of the dawn opened beyond the castellated heights of the
east, she might be seen, in all weathers, hastening to the top of a
small hill, and, with eyes full of the tears of longing, gazing in
every direction to see if she could behold any sign of her
beloved&rsquo;s return; but in vain. At noon, she might be seen on the
same spot again; she was also there at the hour when the sun was wont
to hide himself, like a red-hot ball of fire, below the horizon. She
gazed until she was nearly blind, and she wept forth her soul from day
to day for the darling of her heart. At last they that looked out at
the windows began to refuse their service, and the almond tree
commenced to crown her head with its virgin bloom. She continued to
gaze, but he came not. Full of days, and ripe for the grave, death put
an end to all her hopes and all her expectations. Her mortal remains
were buried in the graveyard of the old Chapel of the Fan<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e9530src" href="#xd25e9530" name=
"xd25e9530src">39</a>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Years passed away like smoke, and generations like the
shadows of the morning, and there was no longer anybody alive who
remembered Rhy&#273;erch, but the tale of his sudden missing was
frequently in people&rsquo;s mouths. And we ought to have said that
after the event no one of the fairies was seen about the neighbourhood,
and the sound of their music ceased from that night. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb191" href="#pb191" name="pb191">191</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;Rhy&#273;erch had been allured by them, and they took him
away into their cave. When he had stayed there only a few days, as he
thought, he asked for permission to return, which was readily granted
him by the king. He issued from the cave when it was a fine noon, with
the sun beaming from the bosom of a cloudless firmament. He walked on
from the Ravens&rsquo; Rift until he came near the site of the Fan
Chapel; but what was his astonishment to find no chapel there! Where,
he wondered, had he been, and how long away? So with mixed feelings he
directed his steps towards Pen Craig Daf, the home of his beloved one,
but she was not there nor any one whom he knew either. He could get no
word of the history of his sweetheart, and those who dwelt in the place
took him for a madman.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He hastened then to Pantannas, where his astonishment was
still greater. He knew nobody there, and nobody knew anything about
him. At last the man of the house came in, and he remembered hearing
his grandfather relating how a youth had suddenly disappeared, nobody
knew whither, some hundreds of years previously. Somehow or other the
man of the house chanced to knock his walking-stick against
Rhy&#273;erch, when the latter vanished in a shower of dust. Nothing
more was ever heard of him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Before leaving Glamorgan, I may add that Mr. Sikes associates fairy
ladies with Crymlyn Lake, between Briton Ferry and Swansea; but, as
frequently happens with him, he does not deign to tell us whence he got
the legend. &lsquo;It is also believed,&rsquo; he says at p. 35,
&lsquo;that a large town lies swallowed up there, and that the <i lang=
"cy">Gwrage&#273; Annwn</i> have turned the submerged walls to use as
the superstructure of their fairy palaces. Some claim to have seen the
towers of beautiful castles lifting their battlements beneath the
surface of the dark <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb192" href="#pb192"
name="pb192">192</a>]</span>waters, and fairy bells are at times heard
ringing from those towers.&rsquo; So much by the way: we shall return
to Crymlyn in chapter vii.</p>

<p class="first">The other day, as I was going to Gwent, I chanced to
be in the Golden Valley in Herefordshire, where the names in the
churchyards seem largely to imply a Welsh population, though the Welsh
language has not been heard there for ages. Among others I noticed
Joneses and Williamses in abundance at Abbey Dore, Evanses and Bevans,
Morgans, Prossers and Prices, not to mention Sayces&mdash;that is to
say, Welshmen of English extraction or education&mdash;a name which may
also be met with in Little England in Pembrokeshire, and probably on
other English-Welsh borders. Happening to have to wait for a train at
the Abbey Dore station, I got into conversation with the tenants of a
cottage hard by, and introduced the subject of the fairies. The old man
knew nothing about them, but his wife, Elizabeth Williams, had been a
servant girl at a place called Pen P&ocirc;ch, which she pronounced
with the Welsh guttural <i>ch</i>: she said that it is near
&#7930;andeilo Cressenny in Monmouthshire. It was about forty years ago
when she served at Pen P&ocirc;ch, and her mistress&rsquo; name was
Evans, who was then about fifty years of age. Now Mrs. Evans was in the
habit of impressing on her servant girls&rsquo; minds, that, unless
they made the house tidy before going to bed, and put everything in its
place overnight, the little people&mdash;the fairies, she thinks she
called them&mdash;would leave them no rest in bed at night, but would
come and &lsquo;pinch them like.&rsquo; If they put everything in its
place, and left the house &lsquo;tidy like,&rsquo; it would be all
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb193" href="#pb193" name=
"pb193">193</a>]</span>right, and &lsquo;nobody would do anything to
them like.&rsquo; That is all I could get from her without prompting
her, which I did at length by suggesting to her that the fairies might
leave the tidy servants presents, a shilling &lsquo;on the hearth or
the hob like.&rsquo; Yes, she thought there was something of that sort,
and her way of answering me suggested that this was not the first time
she had heard of the shilling. She had never been lucky enough to have
had one herself, nor did she know of anybody else that &lsquo;had got
it like.&rsquo;</p>
<p>During a brief but very pleasant sojourn at &#7930;anover in May,
1883, I made some inquiries about the fairies, and obtained the
following account from William Williams, who now, in his seventieth
year, works in Lady &#7930;anover&rsquo;s garden:&mdash;&lsquo;I know
of a family living a little way from here at &mdash;&mdash;, or as they
would now call it in English &mdash;&mdash;, whose ancestors, four
generations ago, used to be kind to <i lang="cy">Bendith y Mamau</i>,
and always welcomed their visits by leaving at night a basinful of
bread and milk for them near the fire. It always used to be eaten up
before the family got up in the morning. But one night a naughty
servant man gave them instead of milk a bowlful of urine<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e9563src" href="#xd25e9563" name=
"xd25e9563src">40</a>. They, on finding it out, threw it about the
house and went away disgusted. But the servant watched in the house the
following night. They found him out, and told him that he had made
fools of them, and that in punishment for his crime there would always
be a fool, i.e. an idiot, in his family. As a matter of fact, there was
one among his children afterwards, and there is one in the family now.
They have always been in a bad way ever since, and they never prosper.
The name of the man who originally <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb194"
href="#pb194" name="pb194">194</a>]</span>offended the fairies was
&mdash;&mdash;; and the name of the present fool among his descendants
is &mdash;&mdash;.&rsquo; For evident reasons it is not desirable to
publish the names.</p>
<p>Williams spoke also of a sister to his mother, who acted as servant
to his parents. There were, he said, ten stepping stones between his
father&rsquo;s house and the well, and on every one of these stones his
aunt used to find a penny every morning, until she made it known to
others, when, of course, the pennies ceased coming. He did not know why
the fairies gave money to her, unless it was because she was a most
tidy servant.</p>
<p>Another &#7930;anover gardener remembered that the fairies used to
change children, and that a certain woman called Nani Fach in that
neighbourhood was one of their offspring; and he had been told that
there were fairy rings in certain fields not far away in &#7930;anover
parish.</p>
<p>A third gardener, who is sixty-eight years of age, and is likewise
in Lady &#7930;anover&rsquo;s employ, had heard it said that servant
girls about his home were wont to sweep the floor clean at night, and
to throw crumbs of bread about on it before going to bed.</p>
<p>Lastly, Mrs. Gardner of Ty Uchaf &#7930;anover, who is ninety years
of age, remembers having a field close to Capel Newy&#273; near Blaen
Afon, in &#7930;anover Uchaf, pointed out to her as containing fairy
rings; and she recollects hearing, when she was a child, that a man had
got into one of them. He remained away from home, as they always did,
she said, a whole year and a day; but she has forgotten how he was
recovered. Then she went on to say that her father had often got up in
the night to see that his horses were not taken out and ridden about
the fields by <i lang="cy">Bendith y Mamau</i>; for they were wont to
ride people&rsquo;s horses late at night round the four corners of the
fields, and thereby they often <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb195"
href="#pb195" name="pb195">195</a>]</span>broke the horses&rsquo; wind.
This, she gave me to understand, was believed in the parish of
&#7930;anover and that part of the country generally. So here we have
an instance probably of confounding fairies with witches.</p>
<p>I have not the means at my command of going at length into the
folklore of Gwent, so I will merely mention where the reader may find a
good deal about it. I have already introduced the name of the credulous
old Christian, Edmund Jones of the Tranch: he published at Trefecca in
the year 1779 a small volume entitled, <i>A Geographical, Historical,
and Religious Account of the Parish of Aberystruth in the County of
Monmouth, to which are added Memoirs of several Persons of Note who
lived in the said Parish</i>. In 1813, by which time he seems to have
left this world for another, where he expected to understand all about
the fairies and their mysterious life, a small volume of his was
published at Newport, bearing the title, <i>A Relation of Apparitions
of Spirits in the County of Monmouth and the Principality of Wales,
with other notable Relations from England, together with Observations
about them, and Instructions from them, designed to confute and to
prevent the Infidelity of denying the Being and Apparition of Spirits,
which tends to Irreligion and Atheism. By the late Rev. Edmund Jones,
of the Tranch.</i> Naturally those volumes have been laid under
contribution by Mr. Sikes, though the tales about apparitions in them
are frequently of a ghastly nature, and sometimes loathsome: on the
whole, they remind me more than anything else I have ever read of
certain Breton tales which breathe fire and brimstone: all such begin
to be now out of fashion in Protestant countries. I shall at present
only quote a passage of quite a different nature from the earlier
volume, p. 72&mdash;it is an interesting one, and it runs
thus:&mdash;&lsquo;It was the general opinion in times past, when these
things were very <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb196" href="#pb196"
name="pb196">196</a>]</span>frequent, that the fairies knew whatever
was spoken in the air without the houses, not so much what was spoken
in the houses. I suppose they chiefly knew what was spoken in the air
at night. It was also said that they rather appeared to an uneven
number of persons, to one, three, five, &amp;c.; and oftener to men
than to women. Thomas William Edmund, of Havodavel, an honest pious
man, who often saw them, declared that they appeared with one bigger
than the rest going before them in the company.&rsquo; With the notion
that the fairies heard everything uttered out of doors may be compared
the faculty attributed to the great magician king, Math ab Mathonwy, of
hearing any whisper whatsoever that met the wind: see the Oxford
<i>Mabinogion</i>, p. 60, and Guest&rsquo;s <i>Mabinogion</i>, iii.
219; see also respectively pp. 94, 96, and pp. 308, 310, as to the same
faculty belonging to the fairy people of the Corannians, and the
strange precautions taken against them by the brothers
&#7930;&ucirc;&#273; and &#7930;evelys. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

were held, so far as I can gather from the descriptions usually given
of them, exactly as I have seen a <i lang="de">kermess</i> or <i lang=

over the Neckar opposite that town. It was in 1869, but I forget what
saint it was with whose name the <i>kermess</i> was supposed to be
connected: the chief features of it were dancing and beer drinking. It
was by no means unusual for a Welsh <i lang="cy">Gwyl Fabsant</i> to
bring together to a rural neighbourhood far more people than could
readily be accommodated; and in Carnarvonshire a hurriedly improvised
bed is to this day called <i lang="cy">gwely

saint&rsquo;s festival.&rsquo; Rightly or wrongly the belief lingers

"xd25e8723" href="#xd25e8723src" name="xd25e8723">28</a></span> The
name &#7930;an Dydoch occurs in the Bruts, <span class="sc">A.D.</span>
987 and 1089, and is the one still in use in Welsh; but the English
<i>St. Dogmael&rsquo;s</i> shows that it is derived from that of
Dogfael&rsquo;s name when the mutation consonant <i>f</i> or <i>v</i>
was still written <i>m</i>. In Welsh the name of the saint has been
worn down to <i lang="cy">Dogwel</i>, as in St. Dogwell&rsquo;s near
Fishguard, and &#7930;an&#273;ogwel in &#7930;anrhu&#273;lad parish in
Anglesey: see Reece&rsquo;s <i>Welsh Saints</i>, p. 211. It points back
to an early Brythonic form <i lang="cy">Doco-maglos</i>, with <i lang=
"cy">doco</i> of the same origin as Latin <i lang="la">dux</i>,
<i>d&#365;cis</i>, &lsquo;a leader,&rsquo; and <i lang="cy">maglo-s</i>
= Irish <i lang="ga">m&#257;l</i>, &lsquo;a lord or prince.&rsquo;
Dogfael&rsquo;s name assumes in &#7930;an <i lang="cy">Dydoch</i> a
Goidelic form, for Dog-fael would have to become in Irish <i lang=
"ga">Doch-mh&#257;l</i>, which, cut down to <i lang="cy">Doch</i> with
the honorific prefix <i>to</i>, has yielded <i lang="cy">Ty-doch</i>;
but I am not clear why it is not <i lang="cy">Ty-&#273;och</i>. Another
instance of a Goidelic form of a name having the local preference in
Wales to this day offers itself in <i lang="cy">Cyfelach</i> and
&#7930;an <i lang="cy">Gyfelach</i> in Glamorganshire. The Welsh was
formerly <i lang="cy">Cimeliauc</i> (Reece, p. 274). Here may also be
mentioned St. Cyngar, otherwise called <i lang="cy">Docwinnus</i>
(Reece, p. 183), but the name occurs in the Liber Landavensis in the
genitive both as <i>Docunn-i</i> and <i>Docguinni</i>, the former of
which seems easily explained as Goidelic for an early form of <i lang=
"cy">Cyngar</i>, namely <i>Cuno-caros</i>, from which would be formed
<i>To-chun</i> or <i>Do-chun</i>. This is what seems to underlie the
Latin <i lang="la">Docunnus</i>, while <i>Docguinni</i> is possibly a
Goidelic modification of the written <i>Docunni</i>, unless some such a
name as <i>Doco-vindo-s</i> has been confounded with <i>Docunnus</i>.
In one instance the Book of &#7930;an D&acirc;v has instead of <i>Abbas
Docunni</i> or <i>Docguinni</i>, the shorter designation, <i>Abbas
Dochou</i> (p. 145), which one must not unhesitatingly treat as
<i>Dochon</i>, seeing that <i>Dochou</i> would be in later book Welsh
<i>Dochau</i>, and in the dialect of the district <i>Docha</i>; and
that this occurs in the name of the church of &#7930;andough near
Cardiff, and &#7930;andough near Cowbridge. The connexion of a certain
saint Dochdwy with these churches does not appear at all satisfactorily
established, but more light is required to help one to understand these
and similar church names.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

<p class="first">In the previous chapters, the fairy lore of the
Principality was hastily skimmed without any method; and I fear that,
now I have to reproduce some of the things which I gleaned somewhat
later, there will be, if possible, still less method. The general
reader, in case he chances on these pages, will doubtless feel that, as
soon as he has read a few of the tales, the rest seem to be familiar to
him, and exceedingly tiresome. It may be, however, presumed that all
men anxious to arrive at an idea as to the origin among us of the
belief in fairies, will agree that we should have as large and
exhaustive a collection as possible of facts on which to work. If we
can supply the data without stint, the student of anthropology may be
trusted in time to discover their value for his inductions, and their
place in the history of the human race.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the course of the summer of 1882<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e9623src" href="#xd25e9623" name="xd25e9623src">1</a> I was a
good deal in Wales, especially Carnarvonshire, and I made notes of a
great many scraps of legends about the fairies, and other bits of
folklore. I will now string <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb198" href=
"#pb198" name="pb198">198</a>]</span>some of them together as I found
them. I began at Trefriw<a class="noteref" id="xd25e9628src" href=
"#xd25e9628" name="xd25e9628src">2</a>, in Nant Conwy, where I came
across an old man, born and bred there, called Morris Hughes. He
appears to be about seventy years of age: he formerly worked as a
slater, but now he lives at &#7930;anrwst, and tries to earn a
livelihood by angling. He told me that fairies came a long while ago to
Cowlyd Farm, near Cowlyd Lake, with a baby to dress, and asked to be
admitted into the house, saying that they would pay well for it. Their
request was granted, and they used to leave money behind them. One day
the servant girl accidentally found they had also left some stuff they
were in the habit of using in washing their children. She examined it,
and, one of her eyes happening to itch, she rubbed it with the finger
that had touched the stuff; so when she went to &#7930;anrwst Fair she
saw the same fairy folks there stealing cakes from a standing, and
asked them why they did that. They inquired with what eye she saw them:
she put her hand to the eye, and one of the fairies quickly rubbed it,
so that she never saw any more of them. They were also very fond of
bringing their children to be dressed in the houses between Trefriw and
&#7930;anrwst; and on the flat land bordering on the Conwy they used to
dance, frolic, and sing every moonlight night. Evan Thomas of Sgubor
Gerrig used to have money from them. He has been dead, Morris Hughes
said, over sixty years: he had on his land a sort of cowhouse where the
fairies had shelter, and hence the pay.</p>
<p>Morris, when a boy, used to be warned by his parents <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb199" href="#pb199" name="pb199">199</a>]</span>to
take care lest he should be stolen by the fairies. He knew Thomas
Williams of Bryn Sy&#7931;ty, or, as he was commonly called, Twm Bryn
Sy&#7931;ty, who was a changeling. He was a sharp, small man, afraid of
nothing. He met his death some years ago by drowning near Eglwys Fach,
when he was about sixty-three years of age. There are relatives of his
about &#7930;anrwst still: that is, relatives of his mother, if indeed
she was his mother (<i lang="cy">os oe&#273; hi&rsquo;n fam i&#273;o
fo, ynt&eacute;</i>). Lastly, Morris had a tale about a mermaid cast
ashore by a storm near Conway. She entreated the fishermen who found
her to help her back into her native element; and on their refusing to
comply she prayed them to place her tail at least in the water. A very
crude rhyme describes her dying of exposure to the cold,
thus:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div lang="cy" class="lg">
<p class="line"><i>Y forforwyn ar y traeth,</i></p>
<p class="line"><i>Crio gwae&#273;u&rsquo;n arw wnaeth,</i></p>
<p class="line"><i>Ofn y deuai drycin drannoeth:</i></p>
<p class="line"><i>Yr hin yn oer a rhewi wnaeth.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">The stranded mermaid on the beach</p>
<p class="line">Did sorely cry and sorely screech,</p>
<p class="line">Afraid to bide the morrow&rsquo;s breeze:</p>
<p class="line">The cold it came, and she did freeze.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">But before expiring, the mermaid cursed the people of
Conway to be always poor, and Conway has ever since, so goes the tale,
laboured under the curse; so that when a stranger happens to bring a
sovereign there, the Conway folk, if silver is required, have to send
across the water to &#7930;ansanffraid for change.</p>
<p>My next informant was John Duncan Maclaren, who was born in 1812,
and lives at Trefriw. His father was a Scotsman, but Maclaren is in all
other respects a Welshman. He also knew the Sgubor Gerrig people, and
that Evan Thomas and Lowri his wife had exceeding great trouble to
prevent their son Roger from being carried away by the fairies. For the
fairy maids were always trying to allure him away, and he was
constantly finding fairy money. The fairy dance, and the playing and
singing that accompanied it, used to take place in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb200" href="#pb200" name="pb200">200</a>]</span>a
field in front of his father&rsquo;s house; but Lowri would never let
her son go out after the sun had gone to his battlements (<i lang=
"cy">ar ol i&rsquo;r haul fyn&rsquo;d i lawr i gaera</i>). The most
dangerous nights were those when the moon shone brightly, and pretty
wreaths of mist adorned the meadows by the river. Maclaren had heard of
a man, whom he called Si&ocirc;n Catrin of Tyn Tw&#7931;, finding a
penny every day at the <i lang="cy">pisty&#7931;</i> or water-spout
near the house, when he went there to fetch water. The flat land
between Trefriw and &#7930;anrwst had on it a great many fairy rings,
and some of them are, according to Maclaren, still to be seen. There
the fairies used to dance, and when a young man got into one of the
rings the fairy damsels took him away; but he could be got out unharmed
at the end of a year and a day, when he would be found dancing with
them in the same ring: he must then be dexterously touched by some one
of his friends with a piece of iron and dragged out at once. This is
the way in which a young man whom my notes connect with a place called
Bryn Glas was recovered. He had gone out with a friend, who lost him,
and he wandered into a fairy ring. He had new shoes on at the time, and
his friends brought him out at the end of the interval of a year and a
day; but he could not be made to understand that he had been away more
than five minutes, until he was asked to look at his new shoes, which
were by that time in pieces. Maclaren had also something to say
concerning the history and habitat of the fairies. Those of Nant Conwy
dress in green; and his mother, who died about sixty-two years ago,
aged forty-seven, had told him that they lived seven years on the
earth, seven years in the air, and seven years underground. He also had
a mermaid tale, like that of Pergrin from Dyfed, p. 163. A fisherman
from &#7930;andri&#7931;o yn Rhos, between Colwyn and &#7930;andudno,
had caught <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb201" href="#pb201" name=
"pb201">201</a>]</span>a mermaid in his net. She asked to be set free,
promising that she would, in case he complied, do him a kindness. He
consented, and one fine day, a long while afterwards, she suddenly
peeped out of the water near him, and shouted: <i lang="cy">Si&ocirc;n
Ifan, cwyd dy rwyda&rsquo; a thyn tua&rsquo;r lan</i>, &lsquo;John
Evans, take up thy nets and make for the shore.&rsquo; He obeyed, and
almost immediately there was a terrible storm, in which many fishermen
lost their lives. The river Conwy is the chief haunt of the mysterious
afanc, already mentioned, p. 130, and Maclaren stated that its name
used to be employed within his memory to frighten girls and children:
so much was it still dreaded. Perhaps I ought to have stated that
Maclaren is very fond of music, and that he told me of a gentleman at
Conway who had taken down in writing a supposed fairy tune. I have made
inquiries of the latter&rsquo;s son, Mr. Hennessy Hughes of Conway; but
his father&rsquo;s papers seem to have been lost, so that he cannot
find the tune in question, though he has heard of it.</p>
<p>Whilst on this question of music let me quote from the &#7930;wyd
letter in the <i>Cambrian Journal</i> for 1859, pp. 145&ndash;6, on
which I have already drawn, pp. 130&ndash;3, above. The passage in
point is to the following effect:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will leave these tales aside whilst I go as far as the Ogo
&#272;u, &ldquo;the Black Cave,&rdquo; which is in the immediate
vicinity of Crigcieth<a class="noteref" id="xd25e9719src" href=
"#xd25e9719" name="xd25e9719src">3</a>, and into which the musicians
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb202" href="#pb202" name=
"pb202">202</a>]</span>entered so far that they lost their way back.
One of them was heard to play on his pipe, and another on his horn,
about two miles from where they went in; and the place where the piper
was heard is called Braich y Bib, and where the man with the horn was
heard is called Braich y Cornor. I do not believe that even a single
man doubts but that this is all true, and I know not how the airs
called Ffarwel Dic y Piby&#273;, &ldquo;Dick the Piper&rsquo;s
Farewell,&rdquo; and Ffarwel Dwm Bach, &ldquo;Little Tom&rsquo;s
Farewell,&rdquo; had those names, unless it was from the musicians
above mentioned. Nor do I know that Ned Puw may not have been the
third, and that the air called Ffarwel Ned Puw, &ldquo;Ned Pugh&rsquo;s
Farewell,&rdquo; may not have been the last he played before going into
the cave. I cannot warrant this to be true, as I have only heard it
said by one man, and he merely held it as a supposition, which had been
suggested by this air of Ffarwel Dic y Piby&#273;.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A story, however, mentioned by Cyn&#273;elw in the <i lang=
"cy">Brython</i> for 1860, p. 57, makes Ned Pugh enter the cave of Tal
y Clegyr, which the writer in his article identifies with Ness Cliff,
near Shrewsbury. In that cave, which was regarded as a wonderful one,
he says the musician disappeared, while the air he was playing, Ffarwel
Ned Puw, <span class="corr" id="xd25e9782" title=
"Source: &lsquo;">&ldquo;</span>Ned Pugh&rsquo;s Farewell,&rdquo; was
retained in memory of him. Some account of the departure of Ned Pugh
and of the interminable cave into which he entered, will be found given
in a rambling fashion in the <i>Cambrian Quarterly Magazine</i>
(London, 1829), vol. i, pp. 40&ndash;5, where the minstrel&rsquo;s
Welsh name is given as Iolo ap Huw. There we are told that he was last
seen in the twilight of a misty Halloween, and the notes of the tune he
was last heard to play are duly given. One of the surmises as to
Iolo&rsquo;s ultimate fate is also recorded, namely, that in the other
world he has exchanged his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb203" href=
"#pb203" name="pb203">203</a>]</span>fiddle for a bugle, and become
huntsman-in-chief to Gwyn ab N&ucirc;&#273;, so that every Halloween he
may be found cheering <i lang="cy">Cwn Annwn</i>, &lsquo;the Hounds of
the Other World,&rsquo; over Cader Idris<a class="noteref" id=

<p>The same summer I fell in with Mr. Morris Evans, of Cerrig
M&acirc;n, near Amlwch. He is a mining agent on the Gwydir Estate in
the Vale of Conwy, but he is a native of the neighbourhood of Parys
Mountain, in Anglesey, where he acquired his knowledge of mining. He
had heard fairy tales from his grandmother, Grace Jones, of &#7930;wyn
Ysgaw near Myny&#273; Meche&#7931;, between Amlwch and Holyhead. She
died, nearly ninety years of age, over twenty years ago. She used to
relate how she and others of her own age were wont in their youth to go
out on bright moonlight nights to a spot near &#7930;yn y Bwch. They
seldom had to wait there long before they would hear exquisite music
and behold a grand palace standing on the ground. The diminutive folks
of fairyland would then come forth to dance and frolic. The next
morning the palace would be found gone, but the grandmother used to
pick up fairy money on the spot, and this went on regularly so long as
she did not tell others of her luck. My informant, who is himself a man
somewhat over fifty-two, tells me that at a place not far from
&#7930;yn y Bwch there were <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb204" href=
"#pb204" name="pb204">204</a>]</span>plenty of fairy rings to be seen
in the grass; and it is in them the fairies were supposed to
dance<a class="noteref" id="xd25e9880src" href="#xd25e9880" name=
"xd25e9880src">5</a>.</p>
<p>From &#7930;anrwst I went up to see the bard and antiquary, Mr.
Gethin Jones. His house was prettily situated on the hillside on the
left of the road as you approach the village of Penmachno. I was sorry
to find that his memory had been considerably impaired by a paralytic
stroke from which he had suffered not long before. However, from his
room he pointed out to me a spot on the other side of the Machno,
called <i lang="cy">Y Wer&#273;on</i>, which means &lsquo;The Green
Land,&rsquo; or more literally, &lsquo;The Greenery,&rsquo; so to say.
It was well known for its green, grassy fairy rings, formerly
frequented by the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth Teg</i>; and he said he could
distinguish some of the rings even then from where he stood. The
Wer&#273;on is on the Bennar, and the Bennar is the high ground between
Penmachno and Dolwy&#273;elan. The spot in question is on the part
nearest to the Conwy Falls. This name, <i lang="cy">Y Wer&#273;on</i>,
is liable to be confounded with <i lang="cy">Iwer&#273;on</i>,
&lsquo;Ireland,&rsquo; which is commonly treated as if it began with
the definite article, so that it is made into <i lang="cy">Y
Wer&#273;on</i> and <i lang="cy">Wer&#273;on</i>. The fairy <i lang=
"cy">Wer&#273;on</i>, in the radical form <i lang=
"cy">Gwer&#273;on</i>, not only recalls to my mind the Green Isles
called <i lang="cy">Gwer&#273;onau &#7930;&iuml;on</i>, but also the
saying, common in North Wales, that a person in great anxiety
&lsquo;sees <i lang="cy">Y Wer&#273;on</i>.&rsquo; Thus, for instance,
a man who fails to return to his family at the hour expected, and
believes his people to be in great anxiety about him, expresses himself
by saying that they will have &lsquo;seen the Wer&#273;on on my
account&rsquo; (<i lang="cy">mi fy&#273;an&rsquo; wedi gwel&rsquo;d y
Wer&#273;on am dana&rsquo;i</i>). Is that Ireland, or is it the land of
the fairies, the other world, in fact? <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb205" href="#pb205" name="pb205">205</a>]</span>If the latter, it
might simply mean they will have died of anxiety; but I confess I have
not so far been able to decide. I am not aware that the term occurs in
any other form of expression than the one I have given; if it had, and
if the Wer&#273;on were spoken of in some other way, that might
possibly clear up the difficulty. If it refers to Ireland, it must
imply that sighting Ireland is equivalent to going astray at sea,
meaning in this sort of instance, getting out of one&rsquo;s senses;
but the Welsh are not very much given to nautical expressions. It
reminds me somewhat of Gerald Griffin&rsquo;s allusion to the Phantom
City, and the penalty paid by those who catch a glimpse of its turrets
as the dividing waves expose them for a moment to view on the western
coast of Ireland:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Soon close the white waters to screen it,</p>
<p class="line">And the bodement, they say, of the wonderful sight,</p>
<p class="line">Is death to the eyes that have seen it.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The Fairy Glen above Bettws y Coed is called in Welsh
Ffos &lsquo;No&#273;yn, &lsquo;the Sink of the Abyss&rsquo;; but Mr.
Gethin Jones told me that it was also called Glyn y Tylwyth Teg, which
is very probable, as some such a designation is required to account for
the English name, &lsquo;the Fairy Glen.&rsquo; People on the Capel
Garmon side used to see the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth</i> playing there, and
descending into the Ffos or Glen gently and lightly without occasioning
themselves the least harm. The Fairy Glen was, doubtless, supposed to
contain an entrance to the world below. This reminds one of the name of
the pretty hollow running inland from the railway station at Bangor.
Why should it be called Nant Uffern, or &lsquo;The Hollow of
Hell&rsquo;? Can it be that there was a supposed entrance to the fairy
world somewhere there? In any case, I am quite certain that Welsh
place-names involve allusions to the fairies <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb206" href="#pb206" name="pb206">206</a>]</span>much
oftener than has been hitherto supposed; and I should be inclined to
cite, as a further example, Moel Eilio<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e9937src" href="#xd25e9937" name="xd25e9937src">6</a> or Moel
Eilian, from the personal name Eilian, to be mentioned presently. Moel
Eilian is a mountain under which the fairies were supposed to have
great stores of treasure. But to return to Mr. Gethin Jones, I had
almost forgotten that I have another instance of his in point. He
showed me a passage in a paper which he wrote in Welsh some time ago on
the antiquities of Yspyty Ifan. He says that where the Serw joins the
Conwy there is a cave, to which tradition asserts that a harpist was
once allured by the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth Teg</i>. He was, of course,
not seen afterwards, but the echo of the music made by him and them on
their harps is still to be heard a little lower down, under the field
called to this day Gweirglo&#273; y Telynorion, &lsquo;The
Harpers&rsquo; Meadow&rsquo;: compare the extract from Edward
&#7930;wyd&rsquo;s correspondence at p. 202 above.</p>
<p>Mr. Gethin Jones also spoke to me of the lake called &#7930;yn
Pencraig, which was drained in hopes of finding lead underneath it, an
expectation not altogether doomed to disappointment, and he informed me
that its old name was &#7930;yn &#7930;ifon; so the moor around it was
called Gwaen &#7930;ifon. It appears to have been a large lake, but
only in wet weather, and to have no deep bed. The names connected with
the spot are now Nant Gwaen &#7930;ifon and the Gwaith (or Mine) of
Gwaen &#7930;ifon: they are, I understand, within the township of
Trefriw. The name &#7930;yn &#7930;ifon is of great interest when taken
in connexion with the Triadic account of the cataclysm called the
Bursting of &#7930;yn &#7930;i&fnof;on. Mr. Gethin Jones, however,
believed himself that &#7930;yn <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb207"
href="#pb207" name="pb207">207</a>]</span>&#7930;&iuml;on was no other
than Bala Lake, through which the Dee makes her way.</p>

<h3 class="main">II.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">One day in August of the same year, I arrived at Dinas
Station, and walked down to &#7930;andwrog in order to see Dinas
Din&#7931;e, and to ascertain what traditions still existed there
respecting Caer Arianrhod, &#7930;ew &#7930;awgyffes, Dylan Eilton, and
other names that figure in the <i>Mabinogi</i> of Math ab Mathonwy. I
called first on the schoolmaster, and he kindly took me to the clerk,
Hugh Evans, a native of the neighbourhood of &#7930;angefni, in
Anglesey. He had often heard people talk of some women having once on a
time come from Tregar Anthreg to Cae&rsquo;r &rsquo;Loda&rsquo;, a
place near the shore, to fetch food or water, and that when they looked
back they beheld the town overflowed by the sea: the walls can still be
seen at low water. Gwennan was the name of one of the women, and she
was buried at the place now called Be&#273; Gwennan, or Gwennan&rsquo;s
Grave. He had also heard the fairy tales of Waen Fawr and Nant y
Bettws, narrated by the antiquary, Owen Williams of the former place.
For instance, he had related to him the tale of the man who slept on a
clump of rushes, and thought he was all the while in a magnificent
mansion; see p. 100, above. Now I should explain that Tregar Anthreg is
to be seen at low water from Dinas Din&#7931;e as a rock not far from
the shore. The Caranthreg which it implies is one of the modern forms
to which Caer Arianrhod has been reduced; and to this has been prefixed
a synonym of <i lang="cy">caer</i>, namely, <i lang="cy">tref</i>,
reduced to <i lang="cy">tre&rsquo;</i>, just as Carmarthen is
frequently called <i lang="cy">Tre&rsquo; Gaerfyr&#273;in</i>.
Cae&rsquo;r &rsquo;Loda&rsquo; is explained as Cae&rsquo;r
Aelodau&rsquo;, &lsquo;The Field of the Limbs&rsquo;; but I am sorry to
say that I forgot to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb208" href="#pb208"
name="pb208">208</a>]</span>note the story explanatory of the name. It
is given, I think, to a farm, and so is Be&#273; Gwennan likewise the
name of a farm house. The tenant of the latter, William Roberts, was at
home when I visited the spot. He told me the same story, but with a
variation: three sisters had come from Tregan Anrheg to fetch
provisions, when their city was overflowed. Gwen fled to the spot now
called Be&#273; Gwennan, Elan to Ty&#273;yn Elan, or Elan&rsquo;s
Holding, and Maelan to Rhos Maelan, or Maelan&rsquo;s Moor; all three
are names of places in the immediate neighbourhood.</p>
<p>From Dinas Din&#7931;e I was directed across Lord Newborough&rsquo;s
grounds at Glyn&#7931;ifon to Pen y Groes Station; but on my way I had
an opportunity of questioning several of the men employed at
Glyn&#7931;ifon. One of these was called William Thomas Solomon, an
intelligent middle-aged man, who works in the garden there. He said
that the three women who escaped from the submerged city were sisters,
and that he had learned in his infancy to call them Gwennan bi
D&ocirc;n, Elan bi D&ocirc;n, and Maelan bi D&ocirc;n. Lastly, the name
of the city, according to him, was Tregan Anthrod. I had the following
forms of the name that day:&mdash;Tregar Anrheg, Tregar Anthreg, Tregan
Anrheg, Tregan Anthreg, and Tregan Anthrod. All these are attempts to
reproduce what might be written Tre&rsquo;-Gaer-Arianrhod. The
modification of <i lang="cy">nrh</i> into <i lang="cy">nthr</i> is very
common in North Wales, and Tregar Anrheg seems to have been fashioned
on the supposition that the name had something to do with <i lang=
"cy">anrheg</i>, &lsquo;a gift.&rsquo; Tregan Anthrod is undoubtedly
the Caer Arianrhod, or &lsquo;fortress of Arianrhod,&rsquo; in the
<i>Mabinogi</i>, and it is duly marked as such in a map of
Speede&rsquo;s at the spot where it should be. Now the Arianrhod of the
<i>Mabinogi</i> of Math could hardly be called a lady of rude virtue,
and it is the idea in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb209" href=
"#pb209" name="pb209">209</a>]</span>neighbourhood that the place was
inundated on account of the wickedness of the inhabitants. So it would
appear that Gwennan, Elan, and Maelan, Arianrhod&rsquo;s sisters, were
the just ones allowed to escape. Arianrhod was probably drowned as the
principal sinner in possession; but I did not find, as I expected, that
the crime which called for such an expiation was in this instance that
of playing cards on Sunday. In fact, this part of the legend does not
seem to have been duly elaborated as yet.</p>
<p>I must now come back to Solomon&rsquo;s <i lang="cy">bi
D&ocirc;n</i>, which puzzles me not a little. Arianrhod was daughter of
D&ocirc;n, and so several other characters in the same <i>Mabinogi</i>
were children of D&ocirc;n. But what is <i lang="cy">bi D&ocirc;n</i>?
I have noticed that all the Welsh antiquaries who take Don out of books
invariably call that personage D&ograve;n or Donn with a short
<i>o</i>, which is wrong, and this has saved me from being deceived
once or twice: so I take it that <i lang="cy">bi D&ocirc;n</i> is, as
Solomon asserted, a local expression of which he did not know the
meaning. I can only add, in default of a better explanation, that
<i lang="cy">bi D&ocirc;n</i> recalled to my mind what I had shortly
before heard on my trip from Aberdaron to Bardsey Island. My wife and
I, together with two friends, engaged, after much eloquent haggling, a
boat at the former place, but one of the men who were to row us
insinuated a boy of his, aged four, into the boat, an addition which
did not exactly add to the pleasures of that somewhat perilous trip
amidst incomprehensible currents. But the Aberdaron boatmen always
called that child <i lang="cy">bi Donn</i>, which I took to have been a
sort of imitation of an infantile pronunciation of &lsquo;baby
John,&rsquo; for his name was John, which Welsh infants as a rule first
pronounce Donn: I can well remember the time when I did. This, applied
to <i lang="cy">Gwennan bi D&ocirc;n</i>, would imply that Solomon
heard it as a piece of nursery lore when he was a child, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb210" href="#pb210" name="pb210">210</a>]</span>and
that it meant simply&mdash;Gwennan, baby or child of D&ocirc;n. Lastly,
the only trace of Dylan I could find was in the name of a small
promontory, called variously by the Glyn&#7931;ifon men Pwynt Maen
Tylen, which was Solomon&rsquo;s pronunciation, and Pwynt Maen Dulan.
It is also known, as I was given to understand, as Pwynt y Wig: I
believe I have seen it given in maps as Maen Dylan Point.</p>
<p>Solomon told me the following fairy tale, and he was afterwards kind
enough to have it written out for me. I give it in his own words, as it
is peculiar in some respects:&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;An old man and his wife lived at the Garth Dorwen in some
period a long while ago. They went to Carnarvon to hire a servant maid
at the Allhallows&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd25e10057src" href=
"#xd25e10057" name="xd25e10057src">8</a> fair; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb212" href="#pb212" name="pb212">212</a>]</span>and
it was the custom then for young men and women who stood out for places
to station themselves at the top of the present <i lang="cy">Maes</i>,
by a little green eminence which was where the present Post-office
stands. The old man and his wife went to that spot, and saw there a
lass with yellow hair, standing a little apart from all the others; the
old woman went to her and asked her if she wanted a place. She replied
that she did, and so she hired herself at once and came to her place at
the time fixed. In those times it was customary during the long winter
nights that spinning should be done after supper. Now the maid servant
would go to the meadow to spin by the light of the moon, and the
<i lang="cy">Tylwyth Teg</i> used to come to her to sing and dance. But
some time in the spring, when the days had grown longer, Eilian escaped
with the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth Teg</i>, so that she was seen no more.
The field where she was last seen is to this day called Eilian&rsquo;s
Field, and the meadow is known as the Maid&rsquo;s Meadow. The old
woman of Garth Dorwen was in the habit of putting women to bed, and she
was in great request far and wide. Some time after Eilian&rsquo;s
escape there came a gentleman on horseback to the door one night when
the moon was full, while there was a slight rain and just a little
mist, to fetch the old woman to his wife. So she rode off behind the
stranger on his horse, and came to Rhos y Cowrt. Now there was at that
time, in the centre of the <i lang="cy">rhos</i>, somewhat of a rising
ground that looked like an old fortification, with many big stones on
the top, and a large cairn of stones on the northern side: it is to be
seen there to this day, and it goes by the name of Bryn y Pibion, but I
have never visited the spot. When they <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb213" href="#pb213" name="pb213">213</a>]</span>reached the spot,
they entered a large cave, and they went into a room where the wife lay
in her bed; it was the finest place the old woman had seen in her life.
When she had successfully brought the wife to bed, she went near the
fire to dress the baby; and when she had done, the husband came to the
old woman with a bottle of ointment<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e10079src" href="#xd25e10079" name="xd25e10079src">9</a> that she
might anoint the baby&rsquo;s eyes; but he entreated her not to touch
her own eyes with it. Somehow after putting the bottle by, one of the
old woman&rsquo;s eyes happened to itch, and she rubbed it with the
same finger that she had used to rub the baby&rsquo;s eyes. Then she
saw with that eye how the wife lay on a bundle of rushes and withered
ferns in a large cave, with big stones all round her, and with a little
fire in one corner; and she saw also that the lady was only Eilian, her
former servant girl, whilst, with the other eye, she beheld the finest
place she had ever seen. Not long afterwards the old midwife went to
Carnarvon to market, when she saw the husband, and said to him,
&ldquo;How is Eilian?&rdquo; &ldquo;She is pretty well,&rdquo; said he
to the old woman, &ldquo;but with what eye do you see me?&rdquo;
&ldquo;With this one,&rdquo; was the reply; and he took a bulrush and
put her eye out at once.&rsquo;</p>
<p>That is exactly the tale, my informant tells me, as he heard it from
his mother, who heard it from an old woman who lived at Garth Dorwen
when his mother was a girl, about eighty-four years ago, as he guessed
it to have been; but in his written version he has omitted one thing
which he told me at Glyn&#7931;ifon, namely, that, when the servant
girl went out to the fairies to spin, an enormous amount of spinning
used to be done. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb214" href="#pb214"
name="pb214">214</a>]</span>I mention this as it reminds me of the
tales of other nations, where the girl who cannot spin straw into gold
is assisted by a fairy, on certain conditions which are afterwards
found very inconvenient. It may be guessed that in the case of Eilian
the conditions involved her becoming a fairy&rsquo;s wife, and that she
kept to them. Lastly, I should like the arch&aelig;ologists of
Carnarvonshire to direct their attention to Bryn y Pibion; for they
might be expected to come across the remains there of a barrow or of a
fort.</p>

<p class="first">The same summer I happened to meet the Rev. Robert
Hughes, of Uwchlaw&rsquo;r Ffynnon, near &#7930;anaelhaearn, a village
on which Tre&rsquo;r Ceiri, or the Town of the Keiri, looks down in its
primitive grimness from the top of one of the three heights of the
Eifl, or Rivals as English people call them. The district is remarkable
for the longevity of its inhabitants, and Mr. Hughes counted fifteen
farmers in his immediate neighbourhood whose average age was
eighty-three; and four years previously the average age of eighteen of
them was no less than eighty-five. He himself was, when I met him,
seventy-one years of age, and he considered that he represented the
traditions of more than a century and a half, as he was a boy of twelve
when one of his grandfathers died at the age of ninety-two: the age
reached by one of his grandmothers was all but equal, while his father
died only a few years ago, after nearly reaching his ninety-fifth
birthday.</p>
<p>Story-telling was kept alive in the parish of &#7930;anaelhaearn by
the institution known there as the <i lang="cy">pilnos</i>, or
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb215" href="#pb215" name=
"pb215">215</a>]</span>peeling night, when the neighbours met in one
another&rsquo;s houses to spend the long winter evenings dressing hemp
and carding wool, though I guess that a <i lang="cy">pilnos</i> was
originally the night when people met to <i>peel</i> rushes for
rushlights. When they left these merry meetings they were ready, as Mr.
Hughes says, to see anything. In fact, he gives an instance of some
people coming from a <i lang="cy">pilnos</i> across the mountain from
Nant Gwrtheyrn to &#7930;ithfaen, and finding the fairies singing and
dancing with all their might: they were drawn in among them and found
themselves left alone in the morning on the heather. Indeed, Mr. Hughes
has seen the fairies himself: it was on the Pw&#7931;heli road, as he
was returning in the grey of the morning from the house of his
<i>fianc&eacute;e</i> when he was twenty-seven. The fairies he saw came
along riding on wee horses: his recollection is that he now and then
mastered his eyes and found the road quite clear, but the next moment
the vision would return, and he thought he saw the diminutive cavalcade
as plainly as possible. Similarly, a man of the name of Solomon Evans,
when, thirty years ago, making his way home late at night through
Glyn&#7931;ifon Park, found himself followed by quite a crowd of little
creatures, which he described as being of the size of guinea pigs and
covered with red and white spots. He was an ignorant man, who knew no
better than to believe to the day of his death, some eight or nine
years ago, that they were demons. This is probably a blurred version of
a story concerning <i lang="cy">Cwn Annwn</i>, &lsquo;Hell
hounds,&rsquo; such as the following, published by Mr. O. M. Edwards in
his <i lang="cy">Cymru</i> for 1897, p. 190, from Mr. J. H.
Roberts&rsquo; essay mentioned above at p. 148:&mdash;&lsquo;Ages ago
as a man who had been engaged on business, not the most creditable in
the world, was returning in the depth of night across Cefn Creini, and
thinking in a downcast frame of mind <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb216" href="#pb216" name="pb216">216</a>]</span>over what he had been
doing, he heard in the distance a low and fear-inspiring bark; then
another bark, and another, and then half a dozen and more. Ere long he
became aware that he was being pursued by dogs, and that they were
<i lang="cy">Cwn Annwn</i>. He beheld them coming: he tried to flee,
but he felt quite powerless and could not escape. Nearer and nearer
they came, and he saw the shepherd with them: his face was black and he
had horns on his head. They had come round him and stood in a
semicircle ready to rush upon him, when he had a remarkable
deliverance: he remembered that he had in his pocket a small cross,
which he showed them. They fled in the greatest terror in all
directions, and this accounts for the proverb, <i lang="cy">Mwy
na&rsquo;r cythraul at y groes</i> (Any more than the devil to the
cross).&rsquo; That is Mr. Roberts&rsquo; story; but several allusions
have already been made to <i lang="cy">Cwn Annwn</i>. It would be right
probably to identify them in the first instance with the pack with
which Arawn, king of Annwn, is found hunting by Pwy&#7931;, king of
Dyfed, when the latter happens to meet him in Glyn Cuch in his own
realm. Then in a poem in the <i>Black Book of Carmarthen</i> we find
Gwyn ab N&ucirc;&#273; with a pack led by Dormarth, a hound with a red
snout which he kept close to the ground when engaged in the chase;
similarly in the story of Iolo ab Huw the dogs are treated as belonging
to Gwyn. But on the whole the later idea has more usually been, that
the devil is the huntsman, that his dogs give chase in the air, that
their quarry consists of the souls of the departed, and that their bark
forebodes a death, since they watch for the souls of men about to die.
This, however, might be objected to as pagan; so I have heard the
finishing touch given to it in the neighbourhood of Ystrad Meurig, by
one who, like Mr. Pughe, explained that it is the souls only of
notoriously wicked men and well-known evil livers. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb217" href="#pb217" name="pb217">217</a>]</span>With
this limitation the pack<a class="noteref" id="xd25e10143src" href=
"#xd25e10143" name="xd25e10143src">10</a> seems in no immediate danger
of being regarded as poaching.</p>
<p>To return to &#7930;anaelhaearn, it is right to say that good
spirits too, who attend on good Calvinists, are there believed in.
Morris Hughes, of Cwm Corryn, was the first Calvinistic Methodist at
&#7930;anaelhaearn; he was great-grandfather to Robert Hughes&rsquo;
wife; and he used to be followed by two pretty little yellow birds. He
would call to them, &lsquo;<i lang="cy">Wryd, Wryd!</i>&rsquo; and they
would come and feed out of his hand, and when he was dying they came
and flapped their wings against his window. This was testified to by
John Thomas, of Moelfre Bach, who was present at the time. Thomas died
some twenty-five years ago, at the age of eighty-seven. I have heard
this story from other people, but I do not know what to make of it,
though I may add that the little birds are believed to have been
angels. In Mr. Rees&rsquo; <i>Welsh Saints</i>, pp. 305&ndash;6, Gwryd
is given as the name of a friar who lived about the end of the twelfth
century, and has been commemorated on November 1; and the author adds a
note referring to the <i>Cambrian Register</i> for 1800, vol. iii. p.
221, where it is said that Gwryd relieved the bard Einion ab Gwalchmai
of some oppression, probably mental, which had afflicted him for seven
years. Is one to suppose that Gwryd sent two angels in the form of
little birds to protect the first &#7930;anaelhaearn Methodist? The
call &lsquo;Wryd, Wryd,&rsquo; would seem to indicate that the name was
not originally <i lang="cy">Gwryd</i>, but <i lang="cy">Wryd</i>, to be
identified possibly with the Pictish name <i>Uoret</i> in an
inscription at St. Vigean&rsquo;s, near Arbroath, and to be
distinguished <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb218" href="#pb218" name=
"pb218">218</a>]</span>from the Welsh word <i lang="cy">gwryd</i>,
&lsquo;valour,&rsquo; and from the Welsh name <i lang="cy">Gwriad</i>,
representing what in its Gaulish form was <i>Viriatus</i>. We possibly
have the name <i lang="cy">Wryd</i> in Hafod Wryd, a place in the
Machno Valley above Bettws y Coed; otherwise one would have expected
<i lang="cy">Hafod y Gwryd</i>, making colloquially, <i lang="cy">Hafod
Gwryd</i>.</p>
<p>Mr. Hughes told me a variety of things about Nant Gwrtheyrn, one of
the spots where the Vortigern story is localized. The Nant is a sort of
a <i lang="fr">cul de sac</i> hollow opening to the sea at the foot of
the Eifl. There is a rock there called <i lang="cy">Y Farches</i>, and
the angle of the sea next to the old castle, which seems to be merely a
mound, is called <i lang="cy">Y &#7930;ynclyn</i>, or &lsquo;The
Whirlpool&rsquo;; and this is perhaps an important item in the
localizing of Vortigern&rsquo;s city there. I was informed by Mr.
Hughes that the grave of Olfyn is in this Nant, with a razed church
close by: both are otherwise quite unknown to me. Coming away from this
weird spot to the neighbourhood of Celynnog, one finds that the
Pennar&#273; of the <i>Mabinogi</i> of Math is now called Pennarth, and
has on it a well-known cromlech. Of course, I did not leave Mr. Hughes
without asking him about Caer Arianrhod, and I found that he called it
Tre&rsquo; Gaer Anrheg: he described it as a stony patch in the sea,
and it can, he says, be reached on foot when the ebb is at its lowest
in spring and autumn. The story he had heard about it when he was a boy
at school with David Thomas, better known by his bardic name of
<i lang="cy">Dafy&#273; &#272;u Eryri</i>, was the
following:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tregaer Anrheg was inhabited by a family of robbers, and
among other things they killed and robbed a man at Glyn Iwrch, near the
further wall of Glynn&#7931;ifon Park: this completed the measure of
their lawlessness. There was one woman, however, living with them at
Tregaer Anrheg, who was not related to them, and as she went out one
evening with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb219" href="#pb219" name=
"pb219">219</a>]</span>her pitcher to fetch water, she heard a voice
crying out, <i lang="cy">Dos i ben y bryn i wel&rsquo;d
rhyfe&#273;od</i>, that is, Go up the hill to see a wonder. She obeyed,
and as soon as she got to the top of the hill, whereby was meant Dinas
Din&#7931;e, she beheld Tregaer Anrheg sinking in the sea.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As I have wandered away from the fairies I may add the following
curious bit of legend which Mr. Hughes gave me:&mdash;&lsquo;When St.
Beuno lived at Celynnog, he used to go regularly to preach at
&#7930;an&#273;wyn on the opposite side of the water, which he always
crossed on foot. But one Sunday he accidentally dropped his book of
sermons into the water, and when he had failed to recover it a <i lang=
"cy">gylfin-hir</i>, or curlew, came by, picked it up, and placed it on
a stone out of the reach of the tide. The saint prayed for the
protection and favour of the Creator for the <i lang=
"cy">gylfin-hir</i>: it was granted, and so nobody ever knows where
that bird makes its nest.&rsquo;</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">One day in August of the same summer I went to have
another look at the old inscribed stone at Gesail Gyfarch<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e10250src" href="#xd25e10250" name=
"xd25e10250src">11</a>, near Tremadoc, and, instead of returning the
same way, I walked across to Criccieth Station; but on my way I was
directed to call at a farm house called &#7930;wyn y Mafon Uchaf, where
I was to see Mr. Edward &#7930;ewelyn, a bachelor then seventy-six
years of age. He is a native of the neighbourhood, and has always lived
in it; moreover, he has now been for some time blind. He had heard a
good many fairy tales. Among others he mentioned John Roberts, a slater
from the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb220" href="#pb220" name=
"pb220">220</a>]</span>Garn, that is Carn Dolbenmaen, as having one
day, when there was a little mist and a drizzling rain, heard a crowd
of fairies talking together in great confusion, near a sheepfold on
&#7930;wytmor Mountain; but he was too much afraid to look at them. He
also told me of a man at Ystum Cegid, a farm not far off, having
married a fairy wife on condition that he was not to touch her with any
kind of iron on pain of her leaving him for ever. Then came the usual
accident in catching a horse in order to go to a fair at Carnarvon, and
the immediate disappearance of the wife. At this point Mr.
&#7930;ewelyn&rsquo;s sister interposed to the effect that the wife did
once return and address her husband in the rhyme, <i lang="cy">Os
by&#273; anwyd ar fy mab</i>, &amp;c.: see pp. 44, 55 above. Then Mr.
&#7930;ewelyn enumerated several people who are of this family, among
others a girl, who is, according to him, exactly like the fairies. This
made me ask what the fairies are like, and he answered that they are
small unprepossessing creatures, with yellow skin and black hair. Some
of the men, however, whom he traced to a fairy origin are by no means
of this description. The term there for men of fairy descent is
<i>Belsiaid</i>, and they live mostly in the neighbouring parish of
Pennant, where it would never do for me to go and collect fairy tales,
as I am told; and Mr. &#7930;ewelyn remembers the fighting that used to
take place at the fairs at Penmorfa if the term <i>Belsiaid</i> once
began to be heard. Mr. &#7930;ewelyn was also acquainted with the tale
of the midwife that went to a fairy family, and how the thieving
husband had deprived her of the use of one eye. He also spoke of the
fairies changing children, and how one of these changelings, supposed
to be a baby, expressed himself to the effect that he had seen the
acorn before the oak, and the egg before the chick, but never anybody
who brewed ale in an egg-shell: see p. 62 above. As to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb221" href="#pb221" name=
"pb221">221</a>]</span>modes of getting rid of the changelings, a
friend of Mr. &#7930;ewelyn&rsquo;s mentioned the story that one was
once dropped into the Glaslyn river, near Be&#273;gelert. The sort of
children the fairies liked were those that were unlike their own; that
is, bairns whose hair was white, or inclined to yellow, and whose skin
was fair. He had a great deal to say of a certain Elis Bach of Nant
Gwrtheyrn, who used to be considered a changeling. With the exception
of this changing of children the fairies seemed to have been on fairly
good terms with the inhabitants, and to have been in the habit of
borrowing from farm houses a <i lang="cy">pade&#7931;</i> and <i lang=
"cy">grade&#7931;</i> for baking. The <i lang="cy">grade&#7931;</i> is
a sort of round flat iron, on which the dough is put, and the <i lang=
"cy">pade&#7931;</i> is the <i>patella</i> or pan put over it: they are
still commonly used for baking in North Wales. Well, the fairies used
to borrow these two articles, and by way of payment to leave money on
the hob at night. All over &#7930;eyn the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth</i> are
represented as borrowing <i lang="cy">pade&#7931; a grade&#7931;</i>.
They seem to have never been very strong in household furniture,
especially articles made of iron. Mr. &#7930;ewelyn had heard that the
reason why people do not see fairies nowadays is that they have been
exorcised (<i lang="cy">wedi eu hoffrymu</i>) for hundreds of years to
come.</p>
<p>About the same time I was advised to try the memory of Miss Jane
Williams, who lives at the Graig, Tremadoc: she was then, as I was
told, seventy-five, very quick-witted, but by no means communicative to
idlers. The most important information she had for me was to the effect
that the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth Teg</i> had been exorcised away (<i lang=
"cy">wedi &rsquo;ffrymu</i>) and would not be back in <i>our</i> day.
When she was about twelve she served at the Ge&#7931;i between Tremadoc
and Pont Aberglaslyn. Her master&rsquo;s name was Si&ocirc;n Ifan, and
his wife was a native of the neighbourhood of <span class="corr" id=
"xd25e10322" title="Source: Carnavon">Carnarvon</span>; she had many
tales to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb222" href="#pb222" name=
"pb222">222</a>]</span>tell them about the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth</i>,
how they changed children, how they allured men to the fairy rings, and
how their dupes returned after a time in a wretched state, with hardly
any flesh on their bones. She heard her relate the tale of a man who
married a fairy, and how she left him; but before going away from her
husband and children she asked the latter by name which they would like
to have, a dirty cow-yard (<i lang="cy">buches fudur</i>) or a clean
cow-yard (<i lang="cy">buches l&acirc;n</i>). Some gave the right
answer, a dirty cow-yard, but some said a clean cow-yard: the lot of
the latter was poverty, for they were to have no stock of cattle. The
same question is asked in a story recorded by the late Rev. Elias Owen,
in his <i>Welsh Folk-lore</i>, p. 82<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e10340src" href="#xd25e10340" name="xd25e10340src">12</a>: his
instance belongs to the neighbourhood of Pentrevoelas, in
Denbighshire.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When I was staying at Pw&#7931;heli the same summer, I
went out to the neighbouring village of Four Crosses, and found a
native of the place, who had heard a great many curious things from his
mother. His name was Lewis Jones: he was at the time over eighty, and
he had formerly been a saddler. Among other things, his mother often
told him that her grandmother had frequently been with the fairies,
when the latter was a child. She lived at Pl&acirc;s Du, and once she
happened to be up near Carn Bentyrch when she saw them. She found them
resembling little children, and playing in a brook that she had to
cross. She was so delighted with them, and stayed so long with them,
that a search was made for her, when she was found in the company of
the fairies. Another time, they met her as <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb223" href="#pb223" name="pb223">223</a>]</span>she
was going on an errand across a large bog on a misty day, when there
was a sort of a drizzle, which one might call either dew or rain, as it
was not decidedly either, but something between the two, such as the
Welsh would call <i lang="cy">gwlithlaw</i>, &lsquo;dew-rain.&rsquo;
She loitered in their company until a search was made for her again.
Lewis Jones related to me the story of the midwife&mdash;he pronounced
it in Welsh &lsquo;midwaith&rsquo;&mdash;who attended on a fairy. As in
the other versions, she lost the sight of one eye in consequence of her
discovering the gentleman fairy thieving; but the fair at which this
happened was held in this instance at Nefyn. He related also how a
farmer at Pennant had wedded a fairy called Bella. This tale proceeded
like the other versions, and did not even omit the fighting at
Penmorfa: see pp. 89, 93, 220. He had likewise the tale about the two
youths who had gone out to fetch some cattle, and came, while returning
about dusk, across a party of fairies dancing. The one was drawn into
the circle, and the other was suspected at length of having murdered
him, until, at the suggestion of a wizard, he went to the same place at
the end of a year and a day: then he found him dancing, and managed to
get him out. He had been reduced to a mere skeleton, but he inquired at
once if the cattle he was driving were far ahead. Jones had heard of a
child changed by the fairies when its mother had placed it in some hay
while she worked at the harvest. She discovered he was not her own by
brewing in an egg-shell, as usual. Then she refused to take any notice
of him, and she soon found her own baby returned; but the latter looked
much the worse for its sojourn in the land of the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth
Teg</i>.</p>
<p>My informant described to me Elis Bach of Nant Gwrtheyrn, already
mentioned, p. 221, who died somewhat more than forty years ago. His
father was a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb224" href="#pb224" name=
"pb224">224</a>]</span>farmer there, and his children, both boys and
girls, were like ordinary folks, excepting Elis, who was deformed, his
legs being so short that his body seemed only a few inches from the
ground when he walked. His voice was also small and squeaky. However,
he was very sharp, and could find his way among the rocks pretty well
when he went in quest of his father&rsquo;s sheep and goats, of which
there used to be plenty there formerly. Everybody believed Elis to have
been a changeling, and one saying of his is still remembered in that
part of the country. When strangers visited Nant Gwrtheyrn, a thing
which did not frequently happen, and when his parents asked them to
their table, and pressed them to eat, he would squeak out drily,
<i lang="cy">Buta &lsquo;nynna buta&rsquo;r cwbwl</i>, that is to say,
&lsquo;Eating that means eating all we have.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He told me further that the servant girls used formerly to take care
to bring a supply of water indoors at the approach of night, that the
fairies might find plenty in which to bathe their children, for fear
that they might use the milk instead, if water was wanting. Moreover,
when they had been baking, they took care to leave the fairies both
<i lang="cy">pade&#7931;</i> and <i lang="cy">grade&#7931;</i>, that
they might do their baking in the night. The latter used to pay for
this kindness by leaving behind them a cake of fairy bread and
sometimes money on the hob. I have, however, not been able to learn
anything about the quality or taste of this fairy food.</p>
<p>He had also a great deal to say about the making of bonfires about
the beginning of winter. A bonfire was always kindled on the farm
called Cromlech on the eve of the Winter Calends or <i lang="cy">Nos
Galan Gaeaf</i>, as it is termed in Welsh; and the like were to be seen
in abundance towards &#7930;ithfaen, Carnguwch, and &#7930;anaelhaearn,
as well as on the Merioneth side of the bay. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb225" href="#pb225" name=
"pb225">225</a>]</span>Besides fuel, each person present used to throw
into the fire a small stone, with a mark whereby he should know it
again. If he succeeded in finding the stone on the morrow, the year
would be a lucky one for him, but the contrary if he failed to recover
it. Those who assisted at the making of the bonfire watched until the
flames were out, and then somebody would raise the usual cry, when each
ran away for his life, lest he should be found last. This cry, which is
a sort of equivalent, well known over Carnarvonshire, of the English
saying, &lsquo;The devil take the hindmost,&rsquo; was in the Welsh of
that county&mdash;</p>

"xd25e10596src" href="#xd25e10596" name="xd25e10596src">14</a>, I had
some stories about the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth Teg</i> from Lowri Hughes,
the widow of John <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb227" href="#pb227"
name="pb227">227</a>]</span>Hughes, who lives in a cottage at Pen
Isa&rsquo;r Dref, and is over seventy-four years of age. An aunt of
hers, who knew a great many tales, had died about six years before my
visit, at the advanced age of ninety-six. She used to relate to Lowri
how the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth</i> were in the habit of visiting Singrug,
a house now in ruins on the land of Pen Isa&rsquo;r Dref, and how they
had a habit of borrowing a <i lang="cy">pade&#7931;</i> and <i lang=
"cy">grade&#7931;</i> for baking: they paid for the loan of them by
giving their owners a loaf. Her grandmother, who died not long ago at a
very advanced age, remembered a time when she was milking in a corner
of the land of Carn Bod&uuml;an, and how a little dog came to her and
received a blow from her that sent it rolling away. Presently, she
added, the dog reappeared with a lame man playing on a fiddle; but she
gave them no milk. If she had done so, there was no knowing, she said,
how much money she might have got. But, as it was, such singing and
dancing were indulged in by the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth</i> around the
lame fiddler that she ran away as fast as her feet could carry her.
Lowri&rsquo;s husband had also seen the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth</i> at the
break of day, near Madrun Mill, where they seem to have been holding a
sort of conversazione; but presently one of them observed that he had
heard the voice of the hen&rsquo;s husband, and off they went instantly
then. The fairies were in the habit also of dancing and singing on the
headland across which lie the old earthworks called Din&#7931;aen. When
they had played and enjoyed themselves enough, they used to lift a
certain bit of sod and descend to their own land. My informant had also
heard the midwife story, and she was aware that the fairies changed
people&rsquo;s children; in fact, she mentioned to me a farm house not
far off where there was a daughter of this origin then, not to mention
that she knew all about Elis Bach. Another woman whom I <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb228" href="#pb228" name="pb228">228</a>]</span>met
near Porth Din&#7931;aen said, that the Din&#7931;aen fairies were only
seen when the weather was a little misty.</p>
<p>At Nefyn, Mr. John Williams (Alaw &#7930;eyn) got from his mother
the tale of the midwife. It stated that the latter lost the sight of
her right eye at Nefyn Fair, owing to the fairy she there recognized,
pricking her eye with a green rush. During my visit to Aberdaron, my
wife and I went to the top of Myny&#273; Anelog, and on the way up we
passed a cottage, where a very illiterate woman told us that the
<i lang="cy">Tylwyth Teg</i> formerly frequented the mountain when
there was mist on it; that they changed people&rsquo;s children if they
were left alone on the ground; and that the way to get the right child
back was to leave the fairy urchin without being touched or fed. She
also said that, after baking, people left the <i lang=
"cy">grade&#7931;</i> for the fairies to do their baking: they would
then leave a cake behind them as pay. As for the fairies just now, they
have been exorcised (<i lang="cy">wedi&rsquo;ffrymu</i>) for some
length of time. Mrs. Williams, of Pw&#7931; Defaid, told me that the
rock opposite, called Clip y Gylfinir, on Bodwy&#273;og mountain, a
part of Myny&#273; y Rhiw, was the resort of the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth
Teg</i>, and that they revelled there when it was covered with mist;
she added that a neighbouring farm, called Bodermud Isa&rsquo;, was
well known at one time as a place where the fairies came to do their
baking. But the most remarkable tale I had in the neighbourhood of
Aberdaron was from Evan Williams, a smith who lives at Yr Ar&#273; Las,
on Rhos Hirwaen. If I remember rightly, he is a native of
&#7930;aniestin, and what he told me relates to a farmer&rsquo;s wife
who lived at the Nant, in that parish. Now this old lady was frequently
visited by a fairy who used to borrow <i lang="cy">pade&#7931; a
grade&#7931;</i> from her. These she used to get, and she returned them
with a loaf borne on her head in acknowledgement. But one day she came
to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb229" href="#pb229" name=
"pb229">229</a>]</span>ask for the loan of her <i lang="cy">troe&#7931;
bach</i>, or wheel for spinning flax. When handing her this, the
farmer&rsquo;s wife wished to know her name, as she came so often, but
she refused to tell her. However, she was watched at her spinning, and
overheard singing to the whir of the wheel:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div lang="cy" class="lg">

<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Little did she know</p>
<p class="line">That Silly go Dwt</p>
<p class="line">Is my name.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">This explains to some extent the <i lang=
"cy">s&igrave;li ffrit</i> sung by a Corwrion fairy when she came out
of the lake to spin: see p. 64 above. At first I had in vain tried to
make out the meaning of that bit of legend; but since then I have also
found the &#7930;aniestin rhyme a little varied at &#7930;anberis: it
was picked up there, I do not exactly know how, by my little girls this
summer. The words as they have them run thus:&mdash;</p>
<div lang="cy" class="lgouter">
<p class="line"><i>Bychan a wy&#273;a&rsquo; hi</i></p>
<p class="line"><i>Mai Trwtyn-Tratyn</i></p>
<p class="line"><i>Yw f&rsquo;enw i.</i></p>
</div>
<p class="first">Here, instead of <i lang="cy">S&igrave;li go Dwt</i>
or <i lang="cy">S&igrave;li ffrit</i>, the name is <i lang=
"cy">Trwtyn-Tratyn</i>, and these doggerels at once remind one of the
tale of Rumpelstiltzchen; but it is clear that we have as yet only the
merest fragments of the whole, though I have been thus far unable to
get any more. So one cannot quite say how far it resembled the tale of
Rumpelstiltzchen: there is certainly one difference, which is at once
patent, namely, that while the German Rumpelstiltzchen was a male
fairy, our Welsh <i lang="cy">S&igrave;li ffrit</i> or <i lang=
"cy">S&igrave;li go Dwt</i> is of the other sex. Probably, in the
&#7930;aniestin tale, the borrowing for baking had nothing to do with
the spinning, for all fairies in &#7930;eyn borrow a <i lang=
"cy">pade&#7931;</i> and a <i lang="cy">grade&#7931;</i>, while they do
not usually appear to spin. Then may we suppose that the spinning was
in this instance done for the farmer&rsquo;s wife on conditions which
she was able to evade by discovering the fairy <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb230" href="#pb230" name=
"pb230">230</a>]</span>helper&rsquo;s name? At any rate one expects a
story representing the farmer&rsquo;s wife laid under obligation by the
fairy, and not the reverse. I shall have an opportunity of returning to
this kind of tale in chapter x.</p>
<p>The smith told me another short tale, about a farmer who lived not
long ago at Deunant, close to Aberdaron. The latter used, as is the
wont of country people, to go out a few steps in front of his house
every night to &mdash;&mdash; before going to bed; but once on a time,
while he was standing there, a stranger stood by him and spoke to him,
saying that he had no idea how he and his family were annoyed by him.
The farmer asked how that could be, to which the stranger replied that
his house was just below where they stood, and if he would only stand
on his foot he would see that what he said was true. The farmer
complying, put his foot on the other&rsquo;s foot, and then he could
clearly see that all the slops from his house went down the chimney of
the other&rsquo;s house, which stood far below in a street he had never
seen before. The fairy then advised him to have his door in the other
side of his house, and that if he did so his cattle would never suffer
from the <i lang="cy">clwy&rsquo; byr</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e10771src" href="#xd25e10771" name="xd25e10771src">15</a>. The
result was that the farmer obeyed, and had his door walled up and
another made in the other side of the house: ever after he was a most
prosperous man, and nobody was so successful as he in rearing stock in
all that part of the country. To place the whole thing beyond the
possibility of doubt, Evan Williams assured me that he had often seen
the farmer&rsquo;s house with the front door in the back. I mention
this strange story in order to compare it, in the matter of standing on
the fairy&rsquo;s foot, with that of standing with one&rsquo;s foot
just inside a fairy ring. Compare also standing on a particular
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb231" href="#pb231" name=

realm of Rhys &#272;wfn&rsquo;s Children: see p. 158 above.</p>

<p class="first">Soon afterwards I went to the neighbourhood of Aber
Soch and &#7930;anengan, where I was lucky enough to find Professor
Owen of St. David&rsquo;s College, Lampeter, since appointed Bishop of
St. David&rsquo;s, on a visit to his native place. He took me round to
those of the inhabitants who were thought most likely to have tales to
tell; but I found nothing about the fairies except the usual story of
their borrowing <i lang="cy">pade&#7931; a grade&#7931;</i>, and of
their changing children. However, one version I heard of the process of
recovering the stolen child differs from all others known to me: it was
given us by Margaret Edwards, of Pentre Bach, whose age was then
eighty-seven. It was to the effect that the mother, who had been given
a fairy infant, was to place it on the floor, and that all those
present in the house should throw a piece of iron at it. This she
thought was done with the view of convincing the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth
Teg</i> of the intention to kill the changeling, and in order to induce
them to bring the right child back. The plan was, we are told, always
successful, and it illustrates, to my thinking, the supposed efficacy
of iron against the fairies.</p>
<p>On the way to Aber Soch I passed by an old-fashioned house which has
all the appearance of having once been a place of considerable
importance; and on being told that its name is Caste&#7931;march, I
began thinking of March ab Meirchion mentioned in the Triads. He, I had
long been convinced, ought to be the Welsh reflex of Labhraidh Lorc, or
the Irish king with horse&rsquo;s ears; and the corresponding Greek
character of Midas with ass&rsquo;s ears is so well known that I need
not dwell on it. So I <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb232" href=
"#pb232" name="pb232">232</a>]</span>undertook to question various
people in the neighbourhood about the meaning of the name of
Caste&#7931;march. Most of them analysed it into <i lang=
"cy">Caste&#7931; y March</i>, the &lsquo;Castle of the Steed,&rsquo;
and explained that the knight of the shire or some other respectable
obscurity kept his horses there. This treatment of the word is not very
decidedly countenanced by the pronunciation, which makes the name into
one word strongly accented on the middle syllable. It was further
related to me how Caste&#7931;march was once upon a time inhabited by a
very wicked and cruel man, one of whose servants, after being very
unkindly treated by him, ran away and went on board a man-of-war. Some
time afterwards the man-of-war happened to be in Cardigan Bay, and the
runaway servant persuaded the captain of the vessel to come and anchor
in the Tudwal Roads. Furthermore he induced him to shell his old
master&rsquo;s mansion; and the story is regarded as proved by the old
bullets now and then found at Caste&#7931;march. It has since been
suggested to me that the bullets are evidence of an attack on the place
during the Civil War, which is not improbable. But having got so far as
to find that there was a wicked, cruel man associated with
Caste&#7931;march, I thought I should at once hear the item of
tradition which I was fishing for; but not so: it was not to be wormed
out in a hurry. However, after tiring a very old blacksmith, whose
memory was far gone, with my questions, and after he had in his turn
tired me with answers of the kind I have already described, I ventured
to put it to him at last whether he had never heard some very silly
tale about the lord of Caste&#7931;march, to the effect that he was not
quite like other men. He at once admitted that he had heard it said
that he had horse&rsquo;s ears, but that he would never have thought of
repeating such nonsense to me. This is not a bad instance of the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb233" href="#pb233" name=
"pb233">233</a>]</span>difficulty which one has in eliciting this sort
of tradition from the people. It is true that, as far as regards
Caste&#7931;march, nothing, as it happens, would have been lost if I
had failed at Aber Soch, for I got the same information later at Sarn
Fy&#7931;teyrn; not to mention that after coming back to my books, and
once more turning over the leaves of the <i lang="cy">Brython</i>, I
was delighted to find the tale there. It occurs at p. 431 of the volume
for 1860. It is given with several other interesting bits of antiquity,
and at the end the editor has put &lsquo;Edward &#7930;wyd,
1693&rsquo;; so I suppose the whole comes from letters emanating from
the great Lhwyd, for so, or rather <i lang="cy">Lhuyd</i>, he preferred
to write his name. It is to the following effect:&mdash;</p>
<p>One of Arthur&rsquo;s warriors, whose name was March (or Parch)
Amheirchion<a class="noteref" id="xd25e10807src" href="#xd25e10807"
name="xd25e10807src">16</a>, was lord of Caste&#7931;march in
&#7930;eyn. This man had horse&rsquo;s ears (resembling Midas), and
lest anybody should know it, he used to kill every <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb234" href="#pb234" name="pb234">234</a>]</span>man
he sought to shave his beard, for fear lest he should not be able to
keep the secret; and on the spot where he was wont to bury the bodies
there grew reeds, one of which somebody cut to make a pipe. The pipe
would give no other sound than &lsquo;March Amheirchion has
horse&rsquo;s ears.&rsquo; When the warrior heard this, he would
probably have killed the innocent man on that account, if he had not
himself failed to make the pipe produce any other sound. But after
hearing where the reed had grown, he made no further effort to conceal
either the murders or his ears. This story of Edward &#7930;wyd&rsquo;s
clearly goes back to a time when some kind of a pipe was the favourite
musical instrument in North Wales, and not the harp.</p>

<p class="first">Some time ago I was favoured with a short but
interesting tale by Mr. Evan Lloyd Jones, of Dinorwig, near
&#7930;anberis. Mr. Lloyd Jones, I may here mention, published not long
ago, in <i lang="cy">&#7930;ais y Wlad</i> (Bangor, North Wales), and
in the <i lang="cy">Drych</i> (Utica, United States of North America),
a series of articles entitled <i lang="cy">&#7930;en y Werin yn Sir
Gaernarfon</i>, or the Folklore of Carnarvonshire. I happened to see it
at a friend&rsquo;s house, and I found at once that the writer was
passionately fond of antiquities, and in the habit of making use of the
frequent opportunities he has in the Dinorwig quarries for gathering
information as to what used to be believed by the people of Arfon and
Anglesey. The tale about to be given relates to a lake called Marchlyn
Mawr, or the Great Horse-lake, for there are two lakes called Marchlyn:
they lie near one another, between the Fron&#7931;wyd, in the parish of
&#7930;andegai, and the Elidyr, in the parishes of <span class=

<p>&lsquo;The Marchlyn Mawr is surrounded by rocks terrible to look at,
and tradition relates how one of the sons of the farmer of Rhiwen, once
on a time, when helping a sheep that had fallen among the rocks to get
away, discovered a tremendous cave there; he entered, and saw that it
was full of treasures and arms of great value; but, as it was beginning
to grow dark, and as clambering back was a difficult matter even in the
light of day, he went home that evening, and next morning with the grey
dawn he set out again for the cave, when he found it without much
trouble. He entered, and began to look about him at the treasures that
were there. In the centre of the cave stood a huge table of pure gold,
and on the table lay a crown of gold and pearls. He understood at once
that they were the crown and treasures of Arthur. He approached the
table, and as he stretched forth his hand to take hold of the crown he
was frightened by an awful noise, the noise, as it were, of a thousand
thunders bursting over his head, and the whole place became as dark as
Tartarus. He tried to grope and feel his way out as fast as he could.
When he had succeeded in reaching to the middle of the rocks, he cast
his eye on the lake, which had been stirred all through, while its
white-crested waves dashed through the jagged teeth of the rocks up to
the spot on which he stood. But as he continued looking at the middle
of the lake he beheld a coracle containing three women, the fairest
that the eye of man ever fell on. They were being quickly rowed to the
mouth of the cave; but the dread aspect of him who rowed was enough to
send thrills of horror through the strongest of men. The youth was able
somehow to escape home, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb237" href=
"#pb237" name="pb237">237</a>]</span>but no health remained in his
constitution after that, and even the mere mention of the Marchlyn in
his hearing used to be enough to make him insane.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Lloyd Jones appends to the tale a note to the following
effect:&mdash;There is a small eminence on the shore of the Marchlyn
Mawr, in the parish of &#7930;andegai, called <i lang="cy">Bryn
Cwrwgl</i>, or the &lsquo;Hill of the Coracle&rsquo;; and <i lang=
"cy">Ogof y Marchlyn</i>, or the &lsquo;Marchlyn Cave,&rsquo; is a name
familiar enough to everybody in these neighbourhoods. There were
some&mdash;unless he ought to say that there still are some&mdash;who
believed that there was abundance of treasure in the cave. Several
young men from the quarries, both of the Cae and of Dinorwig, have been
in the midst of the Marchlyn rocks, searching for the cave, and they
succeeded in making their way into a cave. They came away, however,
without the treasures. One old man, Robert Edwards (Iorwerth Sardis),
used to tell him that he and several others had brought ropes from the
quarry to go into the cave, but that they found no treasure. So far, I
have given the substance of Mr. Jones&rsquo; words, to which I would
add the following statement, which I have from a native of
Dinorwig:&mdash;About seventy years ago, when the gentry were robbing
the poor of these districts of their houses and of the lands which the
latter had enclosed out of the commons, an old woman called Si&acirc;n
William of the Garne&#273; was obliged to flee from her house with her
baby&mdash;the latter was known later in life as the Rev. Robert Ellis,
of Ysgoldy&mdash;in her arms. It was in one of the Marchlyn caves that
she found refuge for a day and night. Another kind of tale connected
with the Marchlyn Mawr is recorded in the Powys-land Club&rsquo;s
<i>Collections, Hist. and Arch.</i>, vol. xv. p. 137, by the Rev. Elias
Owen, to the effect that &lsquo;a man who was fishing in the lake found
himself enveloped in the clouds that had descended <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb238" href="#pb238" name="pb238">238</a>]</span>from
the hills to the water. A sudden gust of wind cleared a road through
the mist that hung over the lake, and revealed to his sight a man
busily engaged in thatching a stack. The man, or rather the fairy,
stood on a ladder. The stack and ladder rested on the surface of the
lake.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="first">Mr. E. S. Roberts, of &#7930;andysilio School, near
&#7930;ango&#7931;en (p. 138), has sent me more bits of legends about
the fairies. He heard the following from Mr. Thomas Parry, of Tan y
Coed Farm, who had heard it from his father, the late Evan Parry, and
the latter from Thomas Morris, of Eglwyseg, who related it to him more
than once:&mdash;Thomas Morris happened to be returning home from
&#7930;ango&#7931;en very late on one Saturday night in the middle of
the summer, and by the time he reached near home the day had dawned,
when he saw a number of the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth Teg</i> with a dog
walking about hither and thither on the declivity of the Eglwyseg
Rocks, which hung threateningly overhead. When he had looked at them
for some minutes, he directed his steps towards them; but as they saw
him approaching they hid themselves, as he thought, behind a large
stone. On reaching the spot, he found under the stone a hole by which
they had made their way into their subterranean home. So ends the tale
as related to Mr. Roberts. It is remarkable as representing the fairies
looking rather like poachers; but there are not wanting others which
speak of their possessing horses and greyhounds, as all gentlemen were
supposed to.</p>
<p>One of Mr. Roberts&rsquo; tales is in point: he had it from Mr. Hugh
Francis<a class="noteref" id="xd25e10975src" href="#xd25e10975" name=
"xd25e10975src">18</a>, of Holyhead House, Ruthin, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb239" href="#pb239" name="pb239">239</a>]</span>and
the latter heard it from Robert Roberts, of Amlwch, who has now been
dead about thirty years:&mdash;About 105 years ago there lived in the
parish of &#7930;andyfrydog, near &#7930;annerch y Me&#273;, in
Anglesey, a man named Ifan Gruffy&#273;, whose cow happened to
disappear one day. Ifan Gruffy&#273; was greatly distressed, and he and
his daughter walked up and down the whole neighbourhood in search of
her. As they were coming back in the evening from their unsuccessful
quest, they crossed the field called after the Dyfrydog thief, Cae
&#7930;eidr Dyfrydog, where they saw a great number of little men on
ponies quickly galloping in a ring. They both drew nigh to look on; but
Ifan Gruffy&#273;&rsquo;s daughter, in her eagerness to behold the
little knights more closely, got unawares within the circle in which
their ponies galloped, and did not return to her father. The latter now
forgot all about the loss of the cow, and spent some hours in searching
for his daughter; but at last he had to go home without her, in the
deepest sadness. A few days afterwards he went to Myna&#273;wyn to
consult John Roberts, who was a magician of no mean reputation. That
&lsquo;wise man&rsquo; told Ifan Gruffy&#273; to be no longer sad,
since he could get his daughter back at the very hour of the night of
the anniversary of the time when he lost her. He would, in fact, then
see her riding round in the company of the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth Teg</i>
whom he had seen on that memorable night. The father was to go there
accompanied by four stalwart men, who were to aid him in the rescue of
his daughter. He was to tie a strong rope round his waist, and by means
of this his friends were to pull him out of the circle when he entered
to seize his daughter. He went to the spot, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb240" href="#pb240" name="pb240">240</a>]</span>and
in due time he beheld his daughter riding round in great state. In he
rushed and snatched her, and, thanks to his friends, he got her out of
the fairy ring before the little men had time to think of it. The first
thing Ifan&rsquo;s daughter asked him was, if he had found the cow, for
she had not the slightest reckoning of the time she had spent with the
fairies.</p>
<p>Whilst I am about it, I may as well go through Mr. Roberts&rsquo;
contributions. The next is also a tale related to him by Mr. Hugh
Francis, and, like the last, it comes from Anglesey. Mr. Francis&rsquo;
great-grandfather was called Robert Francis, and he had a mill at
Aberffraw about 100 years ago; and the substance of the following tale
was often repeated in the hearing of Mr. Roberts&rsquo; informant by
his father and his grandfather:&mdash;In winter Robert Francis used to
remain very late at work drying corn in his kiln. As it was needful to
keep a steady fire going, he used to go backwards and forwards from the
house, looking after it not unfrequently until it was two o&rsquo;clock
in the morning. Once on a time he happened to leave a cauldron full of
water on the floor of the kiln, and great was his astonishment on
returning to find two little people washing themselves in the water. He
abstained from entering to disturb them, and went back to the house to
tell his wife of it. &lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;they are
fairies.&rsquo; He presently went back to the kiln and found that they
were gone. He fancied they were man and wife. However, they had left
the place very clean, and to crown all, he found a sum of money left by
them to pay him, as he supposed, for the water and the use of the kiln.
The ensuing night many more fairies came to the kiln, for the visitors
of the previous night had brought their children with them; and the
miller found them busy bathing them and looking very comfortable in the
warm room where they were. The pay that night <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb241" href="#pb241" name="pb241">241</a>]</span>was
also more considerable than the night before, as the visitors were more
numerous. After this the miller never failed to leave a vessel full of
water in the kiln every night, and the fairies availed themselves of it
for years, until, in fact, they took offence at the miller telling the
neighbours of the presents of money which had been left him in the
kiln. Thenceforth no fairies were known to frequent the kiln belonging
to the Aberffraw mill.</p>
<p>The last tale communicated to me by Mr. Roberts is the following,
which he elicited from Margaret Davies, his housekeeper, by reading to
her some of the fairy legends published in the <i lang=
"cy">Cymmrodor</i> a short while ago&mdash;probably the Corwrion
series, one of which bears great resemblance to hers. Mrs. Davies, who
is sixty-one years of age, says that when her parents, Edward and Ann
Williams, lived at Rhoslydan, near Bryneglwys, in Yale, some
seventy-five years ago, the servant man happened one day in the spring
to be ploughing in a field near the house. As he was turning his team
back at one end of the field, he heard some one calling out from the
other end, <i lang="cy">Y mae eisieu hoelen yn y p&igrave;l</i>, or
&lsquo;The peel wants a nail&rsquo;; for <i lang="cy">p&igrave;l</i> is
the English <i>peel</i>, a name given to a sort of shovel provided with
a long handle for placing loaves in an oven, and for getting them out
again. When at length the ploughman had reached the end of the field
whence he guessed the call to have proceeded, he there saw a small
peel, together with a hammer and a nail, under the hedge. He saw that
the peel required a nail to keep it together, and as everything
necessary for mending it were there ready to hand, he did as it had
been suggested. Then he followed at the plough-tail until he came round
again to the same place, and there he this time saw a cake placed for
him on the spot where he had previously <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb242" href="#pb242" name="pb242">242</a>]</span>found the peel and
the other things, which had now disappeared. When the servant related
this to his master, he told him at once that it was one of the <i lang=
"cy">Tylwyth Teg</i> of that locality that had called out to him. With
this should be compared the story of the man who mended a fairy&rsquo;s
plough vice: see p. 64 above.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Early this year I had occasion to visit the well-known
Hengwrt Library at Peniarth, and during my stay there Mr. Wynne very
kindly took me to see such of the &#7930;anegryn people as were most
likely to have somewhat to say about the fairies. Many of the
inhabitants had heard of them, but they had no long tales about them.
One man, however, told me of a William Pritchard, of Pentre Bach, near
&#7930;wyngwryl, who died at sixty, over eighty years ago, and of a
Rhys Williams, the clerk of &#7930;angelynin, how they were going home
late at night from a cock-fight at &#7930;anegryn, and how they came
across the fairies singing and dancing on a plot of ground known as
<i lang="cy">Gwastad Meiriony&#273;</i>, &lsquo;the Plain of
Merioneth,&rsquo; on the way from &#7930;wyngwryl to &#7930;anegryn. It
consists, I am told by Mr. Robert Roberts of &#7930;anegryn, of no more
than some twenty square yards, outside which one has a good view of
Cardigan Bay and the heights of Merioneth and Carnarvonshire, while
from the Gwastad itself neither sea nor mountain is visible. On this
spot, then, the belated cockfighters were surrounded by the fairies.
They swore at the fairies and took to their heels, but they were
pursued as far as Claw&#273; Du. Also I was told that Elen Egryn, the
authoress, some sixty years ago, of some poetry called <i lang=
"cy">Telyn Egryn</i>, had also seen fairies in her youth, when she used
to go up the hills to look <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb243" href=
"#pb243" name="pb243">243</a>]</span>after her father&rsquo;s sheep.
This happened near a little brook, from which she could see the sea
when the sun was in the act of sinking in it; then many fairies would
come out dancing and singing, and also crossing and re-crossing the
little brook. It was on the side of Rhiwfelen, and she thought the
little folks came out of the brook somewhere. She had been scolded for
talking about the fairies, but she firmly believed in them to the end
of her life. This was told me by Mr. W. Williams, the tailor, who is
about sixty years of age; and also by Mr. Rowlands, the ex-bailiff of
Peniarth, who is about seventy-five. I was moreover much interested to
discover at &#7930;anegryn a scrap of kelpie story, which runs as
follows, concerning &#7930;yn Gwernen, situated close to the old road
between Dolge&#7931;ey and &#7930;anegryn:&mdash;</p>
<p>As a man from the village of &#7930;anegryn was returning in the
dusk of the evening across the mountain from Dolge&#7931;ey, he heard,
when hard by &#7930;yn Gwernen, a voice crying out from the
water:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div lang="cy" class="lg">
<p class="line"><i>Daeth yr awr ond ni &#273;aeth y dyn!</i></p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">The hour is come but the man is not!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">As the villager went on his way a little distance,
what should meet him but a man of insane appearance, and with nothing
on but his shirt. As he saw the man making full pelt for the waters of
the lake, he rushed at him to prevent him from proceeding any further.
But as to the sequel there is some doubt: one version makes the
villager conduct the man back about a mile from the lake to a farm
house called Dyffrydan, which was on the former&rsquo;s way home.
Others seem to think that the man in his shirt rushed irresistibly into
the lake, and this I have no doubt comes nearer the end of the story in
its original form. Lately I have heard a part of a similar story about
&#7930;yn Cynnwch, which has already been mentioned, p. 135, above. My
informant <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb244" href="#pb244" name=
"pb244">244</a>]</span>is Miss Lucy Griffith, of Glynmalden, near
Dolge&#7931;ey, a lady deeply interested in Welsh folklore and Welsh
antiquities generally. She obtained her information from a
Dolge&#7931;ey ostler, formerly engaged at the Ship Hotel, to the
effect that on Gwyl Galan, &lsquo;the eve of New Year&rsquo;s
Day,&rsquo; a person is seen walking backwards and forwards on the
strand of Cynnwch Lake, crying out:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div lang="cy" class="lg">
<p class="line"><i>Mae&rsquo;r awr wedi dyfod a&rsquo;r dyn heb
&#273;yfod!</i></p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">The hour is come while the man is not!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">The ostler stated also that lights are to be seen on
Cader Idris on the eve of New Year&rsquo;s Day, whatever that statement
may mean. The two lake stories seem to suggest that the Lake Spirit was
entitled to a victim once a year, whether the sacrifice was regarded as
the result of accident or design. By way of comparison, one may mention
the notion, not yet extinct, that certain rivers in various parts of
the kingdom regularly claim so many victims: for some instances at
random see an article by Mr. J. M. Mackinlay, on Traces of River
Worship in Scottish Folklore, a paper published in the <i>Proceedings
of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland</i>, 1895&ndash;6, pp.
69&ndash;76. Take for example the following rhyme:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Blood-thirsty Dee</p>
<p class="line">Each year needs three;</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">

<p class="line">She needs none.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the neighbourhood of Ystrad Meurig, between the
Teifi and the Ystwyth basins, almost everybody can <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb245" href="#pb245" name=
"pb245">245</a>]</span>relate tales about the fairies, but not much
that is out of the ordinary run of such stories elsewhere. Among
others, Isaac Davies, the smith living at Ystrad Meurig, had heard a
great deal about fairies, and he said that there were rings belonging
to them in certain fields at Tan y Graig and at &#7930;anafan. Where
the rings were, there the fairies danced until the ground became red
and bare of grass. The fairies were, according to him, all women, and
they dressed like foreigners, in short cotton dresses reaching only to
the knee-joint. This description is somewhat peculiar, as the idea
prevalent in the country around is, that the fairy ladies had very long
trains, and that they were very elegantly dressed; so that it is a
common saying there, that girls who dress in a better or more showy
fashion than ordinary look like <i lang="cy">Tylwyth Teg</i>, and the
smith confessed he had often heard that said. Similarly Howells, pp.
113, 121&ndash;2, finds the dresses of the fairies dancing on the
Freni, in the north-east of Pembrokeshire, represented as indescribably
elegant and varying in colour; and those who, in the month of May, used
to frequent the prehistoric encampment of Moe&#273;in<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e11093src" href="#xd25e11093" name="xd25e11093src">19</a> or
Moy&#273;in&mdash;from which a whole cantred takes its name in Central
Cardiganshire&mdash;as fond of appearing in green; while blue
petticoats are said, he says, to have prevailed in the fairy dances in
North Wales<a class="noteref" id="xd25e11108src" href="#xd25e11108"
name="xd25e11108src">20</a>.</p>
<p>Another showed me a spot on the other side of the Teifi, where the
<i lang="cy">Tylwyth Teg</i> had a favourite spot for <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb246" href="#pb246" name=
"pb246">246</a>]</span>dancing; and at the neighbouring village of
Swy&#273; Ffynnon, another meadow was pointed out as their resort on
the farm of D&ocirc;l Bydy&euml;. According to one account I had there,
the fairies dressed themselves in very long clothes, and when they
danced they took hold of one another&rsquo;s enormous trains. Besides
the usual tales concerning men enticed into the ring and retained in
Faery for a year and a day, and concerning the fairies&rsquo; dread of
<i lang="cy">pren cerdingen</i> or mountain ash, I had the midwife tale
in two or three forms, differing more or less from the versions current
in North Wales. For the most complete of them I am indebted to one of
the young men studying at the Grammar School, Mr. D. &#7930;edrodian
Davies. It used to be related by an old woman who died some thirty
years ago at the advanced age of about 100. She was P&agrave;li, mother
of old Rachel Evans, who died seven or eight years ago, when she was
about eighty. The latter was a curious character, who sometimes sang
<i lang="cy">maswe&#273;</i>, or rhymes of doubtful propriety, and used
to take the children of the village to see fairy rings. She also used
to see the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth</i>, and had many tales to tell of
them. But her mother, P&agrave;li, had actually been called to attend
at the confinement of one of them. The beginning of the tale is not
very explicit; but, anyhow, P&agrave;li one evening found herself face
to face with the fairy lady she was to attend upon. She appeared to be
the wife of one of the princes of the country. She was held in great
esteem, and lived in a very grand palace. Everything there had been
arranged in the most beautiful and charming fashion. The wife was in
her bed with nothing about her but white, and she fared sumptuously. In
due time, when the baby had been born, the midwife had all the care
connected with dressing it and serving its mother. P&agrave;li could
see or hear nobody in the whole place but <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb247" href="#pb247" name="pb247">247</a>]</span>the mother and the
baby. She had no idea who attended on them, or who prepared all the
things they required, for it was all done noiselessly and secretly. The
mother was a charming person, of an excellent temper and easy to
manage. Morning and evening, as she finished washing the baby,
P&agrave;li had a certain ointment given her to rub the baby with. She
was charged not to touch it but with her hand, and especially not to
put any near her eyes. This was carried out for some time, but one day,
as she was dressing the baby, her eyes happened to itch, and she rubbed
them with her hand. Then at once she saw a great many wonders she had
not before perceived; and the whole place assumed a new aspect to her.
She said nothing, and in the course of the day she saw a great deal
more. Among other things, she observed small men and small women going
in and out, following a variety of occupations. But their movements
were as light as the morning breeze. To move about was no trouble to
them, and they brought things into the room with the greatest
quickness. They prepared dainty food for the confined lady with the
utmost order and skill, and the air of kindness and affection with
which they served her was truly remarkable. In the evening, as she was
dressing the baby, the midwife said to the lady, &lsquo;You have had a
great many visitors to-day.&rsquo; To this she replied, &lsquo;How do
you know that? Have you been putting the ointment to your eyes?&rsquo;
Thereupon she jumped out of bed, and blew into her eyes, saying,
&lsquo;Now you will see no more.&rsquo; She never afterwards could see
the fairies, however much she tried, nor was the ointment entrusted to
her after that day. According, however, to another version which I
heard, she was told, on being found out, not to apply the ointment to
her eyes any more. She promised she would not; but <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb248" href="#pb248" name="pb248">248</a>]</span>the
narrator thought she broke that promise, as she continued to see the
fairies as long as she lived.</p>
<p>Mr. D. &#7930;. Davies has also a version like the North Wales ones.
He obtained it from a woman of seventy-eight at Bronnant, near
Aberystwyth, who had heard it from one of her ancestors. According to
her, the midwife went to the fair called Ffair Rhos, which was held
between Ystrad Meurig and Pont Rhyd Fendigaid<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e11134src" href="#xd25e11134" name="xd25e11134src">21</a>. There
she saw a great many of the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth</i> very busily
engaged, and among others the lady she had been attending upon. That
being so, she walked up to her and saluted her. The fairy lady angrily
asked how she saw her, and spat in her face, which had the result of
putting an end for ever to her power of seeing her or anybody of her
race.</p>
<p>The same aged woman at Bronnant has communicated to Mr. D. &#7930;.
Davies another tale which differs from all those of the same kind that
I happen to know of. On a certain day in spring the farmer living at
&mdash;&mdash; (Mr. Davies does not remember the name of the farm) lost
his calves; and the servant man and the servant girl went out to look
for them, but as they were both crossing a marshy flat, the man
suddenly missed the girl. He looked for her, and as he could not see
her he concluded that she was playing a trick on him. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb249" href="#pb249" name=
"pb249">249</a>]</span>However, after much shouting and searching about
the place, he began to think that she must have found her way home, so
he turned back and asked if the girl had come in, when he found to his
surprise that nobody had seen her come back. The news of her being lost
caused great excitement in the country around, since many suspected
that he had for some reason put an end to her life: some accounted for
it in this way, and some in another. But as nothing could be found out
about her, the servant man was taken into custody on the charge of
having murdered her. He protested with all his heart, and no evidence
could be produced that he had killed the girl. Now, as some had an idea
that she had gone to the fairies, it was resolved to send to &lsquo;the
wise man&rsquo; (<i lang="cy">Y dyn hysbys</i>). This was done, and he
found out that the missing girl was with the fairies: the trial was
delayed, and he gave the servant man directions of the usual kind as to
how to get her out. She was watched at the end of the period of twelve
months and a day coming round in the dance in the fairy ring at the
place where she was lost, and she was successfully drawn out of the
ring; but the servant man had to be there in the same clothes as he had
on when she left him. As soon as she was released and saw the servant
she asked about the calves. On the way home she told her master, the
servant man, and the others, that she would stay with them until her
master should strike her with iron, but they went their way home in
great joy at having found her. One day, however, when her master was
about to start from home, and whilst he was getting the horse and cart
ready, he asked the girl to assist him, which she did willingly; but as
he was bridling the horse, the bit touched the girl and she disappeared
instantly, and was never seen from that day forth.</p>
<p>I cannot explain this story, unless we regard it as <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb250" href="#pb250" name="pb250">250</a>]</span>made
up of pieces of two different stories which had originally nothing to
do with one another; consistency, however, is not to be expected in
such matters. Mr. D. &#7930;. Davies has kindly given me two more tales
like the first part of the one I have last summarized, also one in
which the missing person, a little boy sent by his mother to fetch some
barm for her, comes home of himself after being away a year or more
playing with the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth Teg</i>, whom he found to be very
nice, pleasant people; they had been exceedingly kind to him, and they
even allowed him to take the bottle with the barm home at the last.
This was somewhere between Swy&#273; Ffynnon and Carmarthen.</p>
<p>Mr. D. &#7930;. Davies finds, what I have not found anywhere else,
that it was a common idea among the old people in Cardiganshire, that
once you came across one of the fairies you could not easily be rid of
him; since the fairies were little beings of a very devoted nature.
Once a man had become friendly with one of them, the latter would be
present with him almost everywhere he went, until it became a burden to
him. However, popular belief did not adopt this item of faith without
another to neutralize it if necessary: so if one was determined to get
rid of the fairy companion, one had in the last resort only to throw a
piece of rusty iron at him to be quit of him for ever. Nothing was a
greater insult to the fairies. But though they were not difficult to
make friends of, they never forgave those who offended them:
forgiveness was not an element in their nature. The general account my
informant gives of the outward appearance of the fairies as he finds
them in the popular belief, is that they were a small handsome race,
and that their women dressed gorgeously in white, while the men were
content with garments of a dark grey colour, usually including
knee-breeches. As <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb251" href="#pb251"
name="pb251">251</a>]</span>might be expected, the descriptions differ
very much in different neighbourhoods, and even in different tales from
the same neighbourhood: this will surprise no one. It was in the night
they came out, generally near water, to sing and dance, and also to
steal whatever took their fancy; for thieving was always natural to
them; but no one ever complained of it, as it was supposed to bring
good luck.</p>

<p>&lsquo;That is a wonderful thing, that old castle there, he would
say, pointing to the Ynys Geinon Rock. I remember a time when people
would be terrified to go near it, especially at night. There was
considerable danger that one might be taken to <i lang="cy">Bendith eu
Mamau</i>. It is said that there are a great many of them there, though
I know not where they abide. The old folks used to say that there was a
pit somewhere about the middle of the Castle, about a yard wide and
some five or six yards deep, with a stone about three tons in weight
over the mouth of it, and that they had a passage underground from that
pit all the way to the cave of Tan yr Ogof, near the top of the Cwm,
that is, near Adelina Patti&rsquo;s residence at Craig y Nos Castle:
there, it was said, they spent their time during the day, while they
came down here to play their tricks at night. They have, they say, a
gold ladder of one or two and twenty rungs, and it is along that they
pass up and down. They have a little word; and it suffices if the
foremost on the ladder merely utters that word, for the stone to rise
of itself; while there is another word, which it suffices the hindmost
in going down to utter so that the stone shuts behind him. It is said
that a servant from one of the neighbouring farms, when looking for
rabbits in the rock, happened to say the word as he stood near the
stone, that it opened for him, and that he went down the ladder; but
that because he was ignorant of the word to make it shut behind him,
the fairies discovered by the draught putting out their candles that
there was something wrong. So they found him out and took him with
them. He remained living with them for seven years, but at the end of
the seven years he escaped with his hat full of guineas. He had by this
time learnt the two words, and got to know a good deal about the hiding
places of their treasures. He told everything to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb255" href="#pb255" name="pb255">255</a>]</span>a
farmer in the neighbourhood, so the latter likewise went down, and some
used to say that he brought thence thrice the fill of a salt-chest of
guineas, half-guineas, and seven-and-sixpenny pieces in one day. But he
got too greedy, and like many a greedy one before him his crime proved
his death; for he went down the fourth time in the dusk of the evening,
when the fairies came upon him, and he was never seen any more. It is
said that his four quarters hang in a room under the Castle; but who
has been there to see them I know not. It is true enough that the
above-mentioned farmer got lost, and that nothing was heard respecting
him; and it is equally true that his family became very well to do
almost at once at that time. You know as well as I do that they say,
that the fairies have underground passages to the caves of
Ystradfe&#7931;te, near Penderyn. There is the Garn Goch also on the
Drum (now called On&#7931;wyn); they say there are hundreds of tons of
gold accumulated by them there, and you have heard the story about one
of the Gethings going thither to dig in the Garn, and how he
[<i>sic</i>] was transformed by the fairies into a wheel of fire, and
that he could get no quiet from them until he sent them to manufacture
a rope of sand!&rsquo;&mdash;A more intelligible version of this story
has been given at pp. 19&ndash;20 above.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There was formerly an old woman living in a small house near
Ynys Geinon; and she had the power of bewitching, people used to say:
there was a rumour that she spent seven days, seven hours, and seven
minutes with the fairies every year in the cave at the Castle. It was a
pretty general belief that she got such and such a quantity of gold for
every child she could steal for them, and that she put one of those old
urchins of theirs in its place: the latter never grew at all. The way
she used to do it was to enter people&rsquo;s houses <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb256" href="#pb256" name="pb256">256</a>]</span>with
the excuse of asking for alms, having a large dark-grey old cloak on
her back, and the cloak concealed one of the children of <i lang=
"cy">Bendith eu Mamau</i>. Whenever she found the little child of the
good woman of the house in its cradle, she would take upon herself to
rock the cradle, so that if the mother only turned her back for a
minute or two, she would throw the sham child into the cradle and hurry
away as fast as she could with the baby. A man in the neighbourhood had
a child lingering for years without growing at all, and it was the
opinion of all that it had been changed by the old woman. The father at
length threatened to call in the aid of &ldquo;the wise man,&rdquo;
when the old woman came there for seven days, pretending that it was in
order to bathe the little boy in cold water; and on the seventh day she
got permission to take him, before it was light, under a certain spout
of water: so she said, but the neighbours said it was to change him.
However that was, the boy from that time forth got on as fast as a
gosling. But the mother had all but to take an oath to the old woman,
that she would duck him in cold water every morning for three months,
and by the end of that time there was no finer infant in the
Cwm.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Davies has given me some account also of the annual pilgrimage
to the Fan mountains to see the Lake Lady: these are his words on the
subject&mdash;they recall pp. 15&ndash;16 above:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It has been the yearly custom (for generations, as far as I
can find) for young as well as many people further advanced in years to
make a general excursion in carts, gambos, and all kinds of vehicles,
to &#7930;yn y Fan, in order to see the water nymph (who appeared on
one day only, viz. the first Sunday in August). This nymph was said to
have the lower part of her body resembling that of a dolphin, while the
upper part was that of a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb257" href=
"#pb257" name="pb257">257</a>]</span>beautiful lady: this anomalous
form appeared on the first Sunday in August (if the lake should be
without a ripple) and combed her tresses on the reflecting surface of
the lake. The yearly peregrination to the abode of the Fan deity is
still kept up in this valley&mdash;Cwmtaw&euml;; but not to the extent
that it used to formerly.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="first">Mr. Craigfryn Hughes has sent me another tale about
the fairies: it has to do with the parish of &#7930;anfabon, near the
eastern border of Glamorganshire. Many traditions cluster round the
church of &#7930;anfabon, beginning with its supposed building by Saint
Mabon, but which of the Mabons of Welsh legend he was, is not very
certain. Not very far is a place called Pant y Dawns, or the Dance
Hollow, in allusion to the visits paid to the spot by <i lang=
"cy">Bendith y Mamau</i>, as the fairies are there called. In the same
neighbourhood stand also the ruins of Caste&#7931; y Nos, or the Castle
of the Night<a class="noteref" id="xd25e11297src" href="#xd25e11297"
name="xd25e11297src">22</a>, which tradition represents as
uninhabitable because it had been built of stones from &#7930;anfabon
Church, and on account of the ghosts that used to haunt it. However,
one small portion of it was usually tenanted formerly by a &lsquo;wise
man&rsquo; or by a witch. In fact, the whole country round
&#7930;anfabon Church teemed with fairies, ghosts, and all kinds of
uncanny creatures:&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;At a farm house still remaining in the parish of
&#7930;anfabon, which is called the Berth Gron, there lived once upon a
time a young widow and her infant child. After losing her husband her
only comfort in her bereavement and solitary state was young Griff, her
son. He was about three years old and a fine child for his age. The
parish was then crammed full of <i lang="cy">Bendith y Mamau</i>, and
when the moon was bright and full they were wont to keep people awake
with their music till the break of day. The fairies of &#7930;anfabon
were remarkable on account of their ugliness, and they were equally
remarkable on account of the tricks they played. Stealing children from
their cradles during the absence of their mothers, and luring men by
means of their music into some pestilential and desolate bog, were
things that seemed to afford them considerable amusement. It was no
wonder then that mothers used to be daily on the watch lest they should
lose their children. The widow alluded to was remarkably careful about
her son, so much so, that it made some of the neighbours say that she
was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb263" href="#pb263" name=
"pb263">263</a>]</span>too anxious about him and that some misfortune
would overtake her child. But she paid no attention to their words, as
all her joy, her comfort, and her hopes appeared to meet together in
her child. However, one day she heard a moaning voice ascending from
near the cow-house, and lest anything had happened to the cattle, she
ran there in a fright, leaving the door of the house open and her
little son in the cradle. Who can describe her grief on her coming in
and seeing that her son was missing? She searched everywhere for him,
but it was in vain. About sunset, behold a little lad made his
appearance before her and said to her quite distinctly,
&ldquo;Mother.&rdquo; She looked minutely at him, and said at last,
&ldquo;Thou art not my child.&rdquo; &ldquo;I am truly,&rdquo; said the
little one. But the mother did not seem satisfied about it, nor did she
believe it was her child. Something whispered to her constantly, as it
were, that it was not her son. However, he remained with her a whole
year, but he did not seem to grow at all, whereas Griff, her son, was a
very growing child. Besides, the little fellow was getting uglier every
day. At last she resolved to go to the &ldquo;wise man,&rdquo; in order
to have information and light on the matter. There happened then to be
living at Caste&#7931; y Nos, &ldquo;Castle of the Night,&rdquo; a man
who was remarkable for his thorough acquaintance with the secrets of
the evil one. When she had laid her business before him and he had
examined her, he addressed the following remark to her: &ldquo;It is a
<i lang="cy">crimbil</i><a class="noteref" id="xd25e11376src" href=
"#xd25e11376" name="xd25e11376src">24</a>, and thy own child is with
those old <i>Bendith</i> somewhere or other: if thou wilt follow my
directions faithfully and minutely thy child will be restored to thee
soon. Now, about noon to-morrow cut an egg through the middle; throw
the one half away from thee, but keep the other in thy hand, and
proceed to mix it backwards and forwards. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb264" href="#pb264" name="pb264">264</a>]</span>See that the little
fellow be present paying attention to what thou art doing, but take
care not to call his attention to it&mdash;his attention must be drawn
to it without calling to him&mdash;and very probably he will ask what
thou wouldst be doing. Thou art to say that it is mixing a pasty for
the reapers that thou art. Let me know what he will then say.&rdquo;
The woman returned, and on the next day she followed the cunning
man&rsquo;s<a class="noteref" id="xd25e11385src" href="#xd25e11385"
name="xd25e11385src">25</a> advice to the letter: the little fellow
stood by her and watched her minutely; presently he asked,
&ldquo;Mother, what are you doing?&rdquo; &ldquo;Mixing a pasty for the
reapers, my boy.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, that is it. I heard from my
father&mdash;he had heard it from his father and that one from his
father&mdash;that an acorn was before the oak, and that the oak was in
the earth; but I have neither heard nor seen anybody <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb265" href="#pb265" name=
"pb265">265</a>]</span>mixing the pasty for the reapers in an
egg-shell.&rdquo; The woman observed that he looked very cross as he
spoke, and that it so added to his ugliness that it made him highly
repulsive.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That afternoon the woman went to the cunning man in order to
inform him of what the dwarf had said. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;he is of that old breed; now the next full moon will be in four
days&mdash;thou must go where the four roads meet above Rhyd y
Gloch<a class="noteref" id="xd25e11501src" href="#xd25e11501" name=
"xd25e11501src">26</a>, at twelve o&rsquo;clock the night the moon is
full. Take care to hide thyself at a spot where thou canst see the ends
of the cross-roads; and shouldst thou see anything that would excite
thee take care to be still and to restrain thyself from giving way to
thy feelings, otherwise the scheme will be frustrated and thou wilt
never have thy son back.&rdquo; The unfortunate mother knew not what to
make of the strange story of the cunning man; she was in the dark as
much as ever. At last the time came, and by the appointed hour she had
concealed herself carefully behind a large bush close by, whence she
could see everything around. She remained there a long time watching;
but nothing was to be seen or heard, while the profound and melancholy
silence of midnight dominated over all. At last she began to hear the
sound of music approaching from afar; nearer and nearer the sweet sound
continued to come, and she listened to it with rapt attention. Ere long
it was close at hand, and she perceived that it was a procession of
<i lang="cy">Bendith y <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb266" href=
"#pb266" name="pb266">266</a>]</span>Mamau</i> going somewhere or
other. They were hundreds in point of number, and about the middle of
the procession she beheld a sight that pierced her heart and made the
blood stop in her veins&mdash;walking between four of the <i lang=
"cy">Bendith</i> she saw her own dear little child. She nearly forgot
herself altogether, and was on the point of springing into the midst of
them violently to snatch him from them if she could; but when she was
on the point of leaping out of her hiding place for that purpose, she
thought of the warning of the cunning man, that any disturbance on her
part would frustrate all, so that she would never get her child back.
When the procession had wound itself past, and the sound of the music
had died away in the distance, she issued from her concealment and
directed her steps homewards. Full of longing as she was for her son
before, she was much more so now; and her disgust at the little dwarf
who claimed to be her son had very considerably grown, for she was now
certain in her mind that he was one of the old breed. She knew not how
to endure him for a moment longer under the same roof with her, much
less his addressing her as &ldquo;mother.&rdquo; However, she had
enough restraining grace to behave becomingly towards the ugly little
fellow that was with her in the house. On the morrow she went without
delay to the &ldquo;wise man&rdquo; to relate what she had witnessed
the previous night, and to seek further advice. The cunning man
expected her, and as she entered he perceived by her looks that she had
seen something that had disturbed her. She told him what she had beheld
at the cross-roads, and when he had heard it he opened a big book which
he had; then, after he had long pored over it, he told her, that before
she could get her child back, it was necessary for her to find a black
hen without a single white feather, or one of any other <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb267" href="#pb267" name=
"pb267">267</a>]</span>colour than black: this she was to place to bake
before a wood<a class="noteref" id="xd25e11519src" href="#xd25e11519"
name="xd25e11519src">27</a> fire with its feathers and all intact.
Moreover, as soon as she placed it before the fire, she was to close
every hole and passage in the walls except one, and not to look very
intently after the <i lang="cy">crimbil</i> until the hen was done
enough and the feathers had fallen off it every one: then she might
look where he was.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Strange as the advice of the wise man sounded, she resolved
to try it; so she went the next day to search among the hens for one of
the requisite description; but to her disappointment she failed to find
one. She then walked from one farm house to another in her search; but
fortune appeared to scowl at her, as she seemed to fail in her object.
When, however, she was nearly disheartened, she came across the kind of
hen she wanted at a farm at the end of the parish. She bought it, and
after returning home she arranged the fire and killed the hen, which
she placed in front of the bright fire burning on the hearth. Whilst
watching the hen baking she altogether forgot the <i lang=
"cy">crimbil</i>; and she fell into a sort of swoon, when she was
astonished by the sound of music outside the house, similar to the
music she had heard a few nights before at the cross-roads. The
feathers had by this time fallen off the hen, and when she came to look
for the <i lang="cy">crimbil</i> he had disappeared. The mother cast
wild looks about the house, and to her joy she heard the voice of her
lost son calling to her from outside. She ran to meet him, and embraced
him fervently. But when she asked him where he had been so long, he had
no account in the world to give but that he had been listening to
pleasant music. He was very thin and worn in appearance when he was
restored. Such is the story of the Lost Child.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Let me remark as to the urchin&rsquo;s exclamation concerning
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb268" href="#pb268" name=
"pb268">268</a>]</span>the cooking done in the egg-shell, that Mr.
Hughes, as the result of further inquiry, has given me what he
considers a more correct version; but it is no less inconsequent, as
will be seen:&mdash;</p>

<p class="line">Never anywhere have I heard of mixing the pasty in the
shell of a hen&rsquo;s egg.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">In Dewi Glan Ffrydlas&rsquo; story from the Ogwen
Valley, in Carnarvonshire, p. 62 above, it is not the cooking of a
pasty but the brewing of beer in an egg-shell. However what is most
remarkable is that the egg-shell is similarly used in stories from
other lands. Mr. Hartland cites one from Mecklenburg and another from
Scandinavia. He also mentions stories in which the imp measures his own
age by the number of forests which he has seen growing successively on
the same soil, the formula being of the following kind: &lsquo;I have
seen the Forest of Ardennes burnt seven times,&rsquo; &lsquo;Seven
times have I seen the wood fall in Less&ouml; Forest,&rsquo; or
&lsquo;I am so old, I was already in the world before the Kamschtschen
Wood (in Lithuania) was planted, wherein great trees grew, and
<i>that</i> is now laid waste again<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e11568src" href="#xd25e11568" name="xd25e11568src">28</a>.&rsquo;
From these and the like instances it is clear that the Welsh versions
here in question are partially blurred, as the fairy child&rsquo;s
words should have been to the effect that he was old enough to remember
the oak when it was yet but an acorn; and an instance of this explicit
kind is given by Howells&mdash;it comes from &#7930;andrygarn in
Anglesey&mdash;see p. 139, where his words run thus: &lsquo;I can
remember yon oak an acorn, but I never saw in my life people brewing in
an egg-shell before.&rsquo; I may add <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb269" href="#pb269" name="pb269">269</a>]</span>that I have been
recently fortunate enough to obtain from Mr. &#7930;ywarch Reynolds
another kind of estimate of the fairy urchin&rsquo;s age. He writes
that his mother remembers a very old Merthyr woman who used to tell the
story of the egg-shell cookery, but in words differing from all the
other versions known to him, thus:&mdash;</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="first">As to the urchin&rsquo;s statement that he was old and
had lived before, it is part of a creed of which we may have something
to say in a later chapter. At this point let it suffice to call
attention to the same idea in the <i>Book of Taliessin</i>, poem

<p class="first">Before closing this chapter, I wish to touch on the
question of the language of the fairies, though fairy tales hardly ever
raise it, as they usually assume the fairies to speak the same language
as the mortals around them. There is, however, one well-known
exception, namely, the story of Eliodorus, already mentioned, p. 117,
as recorded by Giraldus Cambrensis, who relates how Eliodorus,
preferring at the age of twelve to play the truant to undergoing a
frequent beating by his teacher, fasted two days in hiding in the
hollow of a river bank, and how he was then accosted by two little men
who <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb270" href="#pb270" name=
"pb270">270</a>]</span>induced him to follow them to a land of sports
and other delights. There he remained long enough to be able, years
later, to give his diocesan, the second Menevian bishop named
David<a class="noteref" id="xd25e11658src" href="#xd25e11658" name=
"xd25e11658src">30</a>, a comprehensive account of the people and realm
of Faery. After Eliodorus had for some time visited and revisited that
land of twilight, his mother desired him to bring her some of the gold
of the fairies. So one day he tried to bring away the gold ball with
which the fairy king&rsquo;s son used to play; but he was not only
unsuccessful, but subjected to indignities also, and prevented from
evermore finding his way back to fairyland. So he had to go again to
school and to the studies which he so detested; but in the course of
time he learned enough to become a priest; and when, stricken in years,
he used to be entreated by Bishop David to relate this part of his
early history, he never could be got to unfold his tale without
shedding tears. Among other things which he said of the fairies&rsquo;
mode of living, he stated that they ate neither flesh nor fish, but
lived for the most part on various kinds of milk food cooked after the
fashion of stirabout, flavoured as it were with saffron<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e11670src" href="#xd25e11670" name=
"xd25e11670src">31</a>. But one of the most curious portions of
Eliodorus&rsquo; yarn was that relating to the language of the fairies;
for he pretended to have learnt it and to have found it to resemble his
own <i lang="la">Britannica Lingua</i>, &lsquo;<i lang=
"cy">Brythoneg</i>, or Welsh.&rsquo; In the words instanced Giraldus
perceived a similarity to Greek<a class="noteref" id="xd25e11683src"
href="#xd25e11683" name="xd25e11683src">32</a>, which he accounted
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb271" href="#pb271" name=
"pb271">271</a>]</span>for by means of the fabulous origin of the Welsh
from the Trojans and the supposed sojourn made in Greece by those
erring Trojans on their way to Britain. Giraldus displays quite a
pretty interest in comparative philology, and talks glibly of the
<i lang="la">Lingua Britannica</i>; but one never feels certain that he
knew very much more about it than the author of the <i lang=
"la">Germania</i>, the first to refer to it under that name. Tacitus,
however, had the excuse that he lived at a distance and some eleven
centuries before the advent of Gerald the Welshman.</p>
<p>Giraldus&rsquo; words prove, on close examination, to be of no help
to us on the question of language; but on the other hand I have but
recently begun looking out for stories bearing on it. It is my
impression that such are not plentiful; but I proceed to subjoin an
abstract of a phantom funeral tale in point from <i lang=
"cy">Yst&ecirc;n Sioned</i> (Aberystwyth, 1882), pp. 8&ndash;16.
<i lang="cy">Yst&ecirc;n Sioned</i>, I ought to explain, consists of a
number of stories collected and edited in Welsh by the Rev. Chancellor
Silvan Evans, though he has not attached his name to it:&mdash;The
harvest of 1816 was one of the wettest ever known in Wales, and a man
and his wife who lived on a small farm in one of the largest parishes
in the Hundred of Moe&#273;in (see p. 245 above) in the Demetian part
of Cardiganshire went out in the evening of a day which had been
comparatively dry to make some reaped corn into sheaves, as it had long
been down. It was a beautiful night, with the harvest moon shining
brightly, and the field in which they worked had the parish road
passing along one of its sides, without a hedge or a ditch to separate
it from <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb272" href="#pb272" name=
"pb272">272</a>]</span>the corn. When they had been busily at work
binding sheaves for half an hour or more, they happened to hear the hum
of voices, as if of a crowd of people coming along the road leading
into the field. They stopped a moment, and looking in the direction
whence the sounds came, they saw in the light of the moon a number of
people coming into sight and advancing in their direction. They bent
<span class="corr" id="xd25e11757" title="Source: them">then</span>
again to their work without thinking much about what they had seen and
heard; for they fancied it was some belated people making for the
village, which was about a mile off. But the hum and confused sounds
went on increasing, and when the two binders looked up again, they
beheld a large crowd of people almost opposite and not far from them.
As they continued looking on they beheld quite clearly a coffin on a
bier carried on the shoulders of men, who were relieved by others in
turns, as usual in funeral processions in the country. &lsquo;Here is a
funeral,&rsquo; said the binders to one another, forgetting for the
moment that it was not usual for funerals to be seen at night. They
continued looking on till the crowd was right opposite them, and some
of them did not keep to the road, but walked over the corn alongside of
the bulk of the procession. The two binders heard the talk and
whispering, the noise and hum as if of so many real men and women
passing by, but they did not understand a word that was said: not a
syllable could they comprehend, not a face could they recognize. They
kept looking at the procession till it went out of sight on the way
leading towards the parish church. They saw no more of them, and now
they began to feel uneasy and went home leaving the corn alone as it
was; but further on the funeral was met by a tailor at a point in the
road where it was narrow and bounded by a fence (<i lang=
"cy">claw&#273;</i>) on either side. The procession filled the road
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb273" href="#pb273" name=
"pb273">273</a>]</span>from hedge to hedge, and the tailor tried to
force his way through it, but such was the pressure of the throng that
he was obliged to get out of their way by crossing the hedge. He also
failed to understand a word of the talk which he heard. In about three
weeks after this sham funeral<a class="noteref" id="xd25e11766src"
href="#xd25e11766" name="xd25e11766src">33</a>, there came a real one
down that way from the upper end of the parish.</p>
<p>Such, in brief, is the story so charmingly told by Silvan Evans,
which he got from the mouths of the farmer and his wife, whom he
considered highly honest and truthful persons, as well as comparatively
free from superstition. The last time they talked to him about the
incident they were very advanced in years, and both died within a few
weeks of one another early in the year 1852. Their remains, he adds,
lie in the churchyard towards which they had seen the <i lang=
"cy">toeli</i> slowly making its way. For <i lang="cy">toeli</i> is the
phonetic spelling in <i lang="cy">Yst&ecirc;n Sioned</i> of the word
which is <i lang="cy">teulu</i> in North Cardiganshire and in North
Wales, for Old Welsh <i lang="cy">toulu</i>. The word now means
&lsquo;family,&rsquo; though literally it should mean
&lsquo;house-army&rsquo; or &lsquo;house-troops,&rsquo; and it is
practically a synonym for <i lang="cy">tylwyth</i>, &lsquo;family or
household,&rsquo; literally &lsquo;house-tribe.&rsquo; Now the <i lang=
"cy">toeli</i> or <i lang="cy">toulu</i> is such an important
institution in Demetian Cardiganshire and some parts of Dyfed proper,
that the word has been confined to the phantom, and for the word family
in its ordinary significations one has there to have recourse to the
non-dialect form <i lang="cy">teulu</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e11813src" href="#xd25e11813" name="xd25e11813src">34</a>. In
North Cardiganshire and North Wales the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb274" href="#pb274" name="pb274">274</a>]</span><i lang=
"cy">toeli</i> is called simply a <i lang="cy">cla&#273;edigaeth</i>,
&lsquo;burial,&rsquo; or <i lang="cy">angla&#273;</i>,
&lsquo;funeral&rsquo;; in the latter also <i lang="cy">cynhebrwng</i>
is a funeral. I may add that when I was a child in the neighbourhood of
Ponterwyd, on the upper course of the Rheidol, hardly a year used to
pass without somebody or other meeting a phantom funeral. Sometimes one
got entangled in the procession, and ran the risk of being carried off
one&rsquo;s feet by the throng. There is, however, one serious
difference between our phantom funerals and the Demetian <i lang=
"cy">toeli</i>, namely, that we recognize our neighbours&rsquo; ghosts
as making up the processions, and we have no trouble in understanding
their talk. At this point a question of some difficulty presents itself
as to the <i lang="cy">toeli</i>, namely, what family does it
mean?&mdash;is it the family and friends of the departed on his way to
the grave, or does it mean the family in the sense of <i lang=
"cy">Tylwyth Teg</i>, &lsquo;Fair Family,&rsquo; as applied to the
fairies? I am inclined to the latter view, but I prefer thinking that
the distinction itself does not penetrate very deeply, seeing that a
certain species of the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth Teg</i>, or fairies, may,
in point of origin, be regarded as deceased friends and ancestors of
the <i lang="cy">tylwyth</i>, in the ordinary sense of the word. In
fact all this kind of rehearsal of events seems to have been once
looked at as friendly to the men and women whom it concerned. This will
be seen, for instance, in the Demetian account of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb275" href="#pb275" name=
"pb275">275</a>]</span><i lang="cy">canwy&#7931; gorff</i>, or corpse
candle, as granted through the intercession of St. David to the people
of his special care, as a means of warning each to get ready in time
for his death; that is to say, to prevent death finding him unprepared.
It is hard to guess why it was assumed that the <i lang=
"cy">canwy&#7931; gorff</i> was unknown in other parts of Wales. One or
two instances in point occur in Owen&rsquo;s <i>Welsh Folklore</i>, pp.
298&ndash;301; and I have myself heard of them being seen in Anglesey,
while they were quite well known to members of Mrs. Rhys&rsquo;
mother&rsquo;s family, who lived in the parish of Waen Fawr, in the
neighbourhood of Carnarvon. Nor does it appear that phantom funerals
were at all confined to South Wales. Proof to the contrary is supplied
to some extent in Owen&rsquo;s <i>Folklore</i>, p. 301; but there is no
doubt that in recent times the belief in them, as well as in the
<i lang="cy">canwy&#7931; gorff</i>, has been more general and more
vivid in South Wales than in North Wales, especially Gwyne&#273;.</p>
<p>I have not been fortunate enough to come across anything systematic
or comprehensive on the origin and meaning of ghostly rehearsals like
the Welsh phantom funeral or coffin making. But the subject is an
interesting one which deserves the attention of our leading folklore
philosophers, as does also the cognate one of second sight, by which it
is widely overlapped.</p>
<p>Quite recently&mdash;at the end of 1899 in fact&mdash;I received
three brief stories, for which I am indebted to the further kindness of
Alaw &#7930;eyn (p. 228), who lives at Bynhadlog near Edern in
&#7930;eyn, and two out of the three touch on the question of language.
But as the three belong to one and the same district, I give the
substance of all in English as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) There were at a small harbour belonging to Nefyn some houses in
which several families formerly lived; the houses are there still, but
nobody lives in them now. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb276" href=
"#pb276" name="pb276">276</a>]</span>There was one family there to
which a little girl belonged: they used to lose her for hours every
day; so her mother was very angry with her for being so much away.
&lsquo;I must know,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;where you go for your
play.&rsquo; The girl answered that it was to Pin y Wig, &lsquo;The Wig
Point,&rsquo; which meant a place to the west of the Nefyn headland: it
was there, she said, she played with many children. &lsquo;Whose
children?&rsquo; asked the mother. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo;
she replied; &lsquo;they are very nice children, much nicer than I
am.&rsquo; &lsquo;I must know whose children they are,&rsquo; was the
reply; and one day the mother went with her little girl to see the
children: it was a distance of about a quarter of a mile to Pin y Wig,
and after climbing the slope and walking a little along the top they
came in sight of the Pin. It is from this Pin that the people of Pen yr
A&#7931;t got water, and it is from there they get it still. Now after
coming near the Pin the little girl raised her hands with joy at the
sight of the children. &lsquo;O mother,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;their
father is with them to-day: he is not with them always, it is only
sometimes that he is.&rsquo; The mother asked the child where she saw
them. &lsquo;There they are, mother, running down to the Pin, with
their father sitting down.&rsquo; &lsquo;I see nobody, my child,&rsquo;
was the reply, and great fear came upon the mother: she took hold of
the child&rsquo;s hand in terror, and it came to her mind at once that
they were the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth Teg</i>. Never afterwards was the
little girl allowed to go to Pin y Wig: the mother had heard that the
<i lang="cy">Tylwyth Teg</i> exchanged people&rsquo;s children.</p>
<p>Such is the first story, and it is only remarkable, perhaps, for its
allusion to the father of the fairy children.</p>
<p>(2) There used to be at Edern an old woman who occupied a small farm
called Glan y Gors: the same family lives there still. One day this old
woman had gone to a fair at Criccieth, whence she returned through
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb277" href="#pb277" name=
"pb277">277</a>]</span>Pw&#7931;heli. As she was getting above Gors
Geirch, which was then a turbary and a pretty considerable bog, a noise
reached her ears: she stopped and heard the sound of much talking.
By-and-by she beheld a great crowd of men and women coming to meet her.
She became afraid and stepped across the fence to let them go by. There
she remained a while listening to their chatter, and when she thought
that they had gone far enough she returned to the road and began to
resume her way home. But before she had gone many steps she heard the
same sort of noise again, and saw again the same sort of crowd coming;
so she recrossed the fence in great fear, saying to herself,
&lsquo;Here I shall be all night!&rsquo; She remained there till they
also had gone, and she wondered what they could be, and whether they
were people who had been to visit Plas Madrun&mdash;afterwards, on
inquiry, she found that no such people had been there that day. Now the
old woman was near enough to the passers-by to hear them talking
(<i lang="cy">clebran</i>) and chattering (<i lang="cy">bregliach</i>),
but not a word could she understand of what they uttered: it was not
Welsh and she did not think that it was English&mdash;it is, however,
not supposed that she knew English. She related further that the last
crowd shouted all together to the other crowd in advance of them
<i lang="cy">Wi</i>, and that the latter replied <i lang="cy">Wi
Wei</i> or something like that.</p>
<p>This account Alaw &#7930;eyn has got, he says, from a
great-granddaughter of the old woman, and she heard it all from her
father, Bar&#273; &#7930;echog, who always had faith in the fairies,
and believed that they will come again to be seen of men and women. For
he thought that they had their periods, a belief which I have come
across elsewhere, and more especially in Carnarvonshire<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e11921src" href="#xd25e11921" name=
"xd25e11921src">35</a>. Now what are we to make of such a story? I
recollect <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb278" href="#pb278" name=
"pb278">278</a>]</span>reading somewhere of a phantom wedding in
Scotland, but in Wales we seem to have nothing more closely resembling
this than a phantom funeral. Nevertheless what the old woman of Glan y
Gors thought she saw looks by no means unlike a Welsh wedding marching
on foot, especially when, as I have seen done, one party
tried&mdash;seemingly in good earnest&mdash;to escape the other and to
take the bride away from it. Moreover, that the figures making up the
two crowds in her story are to be regarded as fairies is rendered
probable by the next story, which describes the phantoms therein
expressly as little men and little women.</p>
<p>(3) The small farm of Perth y Celyn in Edern used to be held by an
old man named Griffith Griffiths. In his best days he stood six foot,
and he has left behind him a double reputation for bodily strength and
great piety. My informant can well remember him walking to chapel with
the aid of his two sticks. The story goes that one day, when he was in
his prime, he set out from Perth y Celyn at two in the morning to walk
to Carnarvon to pay his rent: there was no talk in those days of a
carriage for anybody. After passing through Nefyn and Pisty&#7931;, he
came in due time to Bwlch Trwyn Swncwl<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e11928src" href="#xd25e11928" name="xd25e11928src">36</a>: he
writes this name also Bwlch Drws Wncwl, with the suggestion that it
ought to be Bwlch Drws Encil, and that the place must have been of
importance in the wars of the ancient Kymry. The high-road, he goes on
to say, runs through the Bwlch, and as Griffith was entering this gap
what should he hear but a great deal of talking. He stopped and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb279" href="#pb279" name=
"pb279">279</a>]</span>listened, when to his surprise he saw coming
towards him, devoid of all fear, a crowd of little men and little
women. They talked aloud, but he could not understand a single word
they said: he thought that it was neither Welsh nor English. They
passed by him on the road, but he moved aside to the ditch lest they
should knock against him; but no feeling of fear came upon him. The old
man believed them to have been the <i lang="cy">Tylwyth Teg</i>.</p>
<p>In the story of the Moe&#273;in funeral the language of the <i lang=
"cy">toeli</i> was not intelligible to the farmer and his wife, or to
the tailor, and here in two stories from &#7930;eyn we have it clearly
stated that it was neither Welsh nor, probably, English. Since the
fairies are always represented as old-fashioned in their ways, it is
quite possible that they were once regarded as talking a more ancient
language of the country. Which was it? An early version of these
legends might perhaps have supplied the answer, and told us that it was
<i lang="cy">Gwy&#273;elig</i> or Goidelic, if not an earlier idiom, to
wit that of the Aborigines before they learnt Goidelic from the Celts
of the first wave of Aryan invasion, whether it was in the region of
the Eifl or in the Demetian half of Keredigion. As to the former it is
worthy of note that when Griffith had reached Bwlch Trwyn Swncwl he was
in the outskirts of the Eifl Mountains, on one of whose heights, not
very far off, is the extensive prehistoric fortress of Tre&rsquo;r
Ceiri, or the Town of the Keiri, a vocable which may be provisionally
rendered by &lsquo;giants.&rsquo; In any case it dissociates that
stronghold from the Brythonic people of Wales. We shall find, however,
that a Goidel, or Pict, buried in a cairn on Snowdon, is known as Rhita
<i lang="cy">Gawr</i>, &lsquo;Rhita the Giant&rsquo;; and it is
possible that in the Keiri of <i lang="cy">Tre&rsquo;r Ceiri</i> we
have no other race than that of mixed Goidels and Picts whom the
encroaching Brythons <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb280" href="#pb280"
name="pb280">280</a>]</span>found in possession of the west of our
island. Nay, one may say that this is rendered probable by the use made
of the word <i lang="cy">ceiri</i> in medieval Welsh: thus in some
poetry composed by a certain Dafy&#273; Offeiriad, and copied by Thomas
Williams of Trefriw, we have a line alluding to Britain in the
words:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div lang="cy" class="lg">
<p class="line"><i>Coron ynys y Ce&ucirc;ri</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e11962src" href="#xd25e11962" name="xd25e11962src">37</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">The Crown of the Giants&rsquo; Island.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">Here <i lang="cy">Ynys y Ce&ucirc;ri</i> inevitably
recalls the fact that Britain is called <i lang="cy">Ynys y Kedyrn</i>,
or Island of the Mighty, in the <i>Mabinogion</i>, and also, in effect,
in the story of Kulhwch and Olwen. But such stories as these, which
enabled Geoffrey to say, i. 16, when he introduced his banal brood of
Trojans, that up to that time Britain had only been inhabited by a few
giants, are the legends, as will be pointed out later, of the
Brythonicized Goidels of Wales. So one may infer that their ancestors
had given this country the name of the Island of the Mighty, unless it
should prove more accurate to suppose them to have somehow derived the
term from the Aborigines.</p>
<p>This last surmise is countenanced by the fact that in the Kulhwch
story, the British Isles as a group are called Islands of the Mighty.
The words are <i lang="cy">Teir ynys y kedyrn ae their rac ynys</i>;
that is, the Three Islands of the Mighty and their Three outpost
Islands. That is not all, for in the same story the designation is
varied thus: <i lang="cy">Teir ynys prydein ae their rac
ynys</i><a class="noteref" id="xd25e12027src" href="#xd25e12027" name=
"xd25e12027src">38</a>, or <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb281" href=
"#pb281" name="pb281">281</a>]</span>Prydain&rsquo;s Three Islands and
Prydain&rsquo;s Three outpost Islands; and the substantial antiquity of
the designation &lsquo;the Islands of Prydain,&rsquo; is proved by its
virtual identity with that used by ancient Greek authors like Ptolemy,
who calls both Britain and Ireland a <span class="trans" title=
"n&#275;sos Pretanik&#275;"><span class="Greek" lang=
"grc">&nu;&#8134;&sigma;&omicron;&sigmaf;
&Pi;&rho;&epsilon;&tau;&alpha;&nu;&iota;&kappa;&#8053;</span></span>,
where <i>Pretanic</i> and <i>Prydain</i> are closely related words. Now
our <i>Prydain</i> had in medieval Welsh the two forms <i>Prydein</i>
and <i>Prydyn</i>. But some time or other there set in a tendency to
desynonymize them, so as to make <i>Ynys Prydein</i>, &lsquo;the
Picts&rsquo; Island,&rsquo; mean Great Britain, and <i lang=
"cy">Prydyn</i> mean the Pictland of the North. But just as <i lang=
"cy">Cymry</i> meant the plural Welshmen <i>and</i> the singular Wales,
so <i lang="cy">Prydyn</i> meant Picts<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e12080src" href="#xd25e12080" name="xd25e12080src">39</a>
<i>and</i> the country of the Picts. Now the plural <i lang=
"cy">Prydyn</i> has its etymological Goidelic equivalent in the vocable
<i lang="cy">Cruithni</i>, which is well known to have meant the Picts
or the descendants of the <i lang="la">Picti</i> of Roman historians.
Further, this last name cannot be severed from that of the <i lang=
"la">Pictones</i><a class="noteref" id="xd25e12117src" href=
"#xd25e12117" name="xd25e12117src">40</a> in Gaul, and it is usually
supposed to have referred to their habit of tattooing themselves. At
all events this agrees with the apparent meaning of the names <i lang=
"cy">Prydyn</i> and <i lang="cy">Cruithni</i>, from <i lang=
"cy">pryd</i> and <i lang="cy">cruth</i>, the words in Welsh and Irish
respectively for <i>form</i> or <i>shape</i>, the designation being
supposed to refer to the forms or pictures of various animals punctured
on the skins of the Picts. So much as to the practical identity of the
terms <i lang="cy">Prydyn</i>, <i lang="cy">Cruithni</i>, and the
Greeks&rsquo; <i>Pretanic</i>; but how could <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb282" href="#pb282" name=
"pb282">282</a>]</span><i>Cedyrn</i> and <i>Prydein</i> correspond in
the terms <i>Ynys y Kedyrn</i> and <i>Ynys Prydein</i>? This one is
enabled to understand by means of <i>ce&ucirc;ri</i> or <i>ceiri</i> as
a middle term. Now <i>cadarn</i> means strong or valiant, and makes the
plural <i>cedyrn</i>; but there is another Welsh word
<i>cadr</i><a class="noteref" id="xd25e12183src" href="#xd25e12183"
name="xd25e12183src">41</a> which has also the meaning of valiant or
powerful, and may have yielded some such a medieval form as
<i>ceidyr</i> in the plural. Now this <i>cadr</i> is proved by its
cognates<a class="noteref" id="xd25e12299src" href="#xd25e12299" name=
"xd25e12299src">42</a> not to have always had the meaning of valiant or
strong: its original signification was more nearly &lsquo;fine,
beautiful, or beautified.&rsquo; Thus what seems to have happened is,
that <i>cadarn</i>, &lsquo;strong, powerful, mighty,&rsquo; influenced
the meaning of <i>cadr</i>, &lsquo;beautiful,&rsquo; and eventually
usurped its place in the name of the island, which from being <i lang=
"cy">Ynys y Ceidyr</i> became <i lang="cy">Ynys y Cedyrn</i>. But the
former meant the &lsquo;Island of the fine or beautiful men,&rsquo;
which was closely enough the meaning also of the words Prydain,
Cruithni, and Picts, as names of a people who delighted to beautify
their persons by tattooing their <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb283"
href="#pb283" name="pb283">283</a>]</span>skins and making themselves
<i>distingu&eacute;</i> in that savage fashion. That is not all, for on
examination it turns out that the word <i>ceiri</i>, which has been
treated up to this point as meaning giants, is but a double, so to say,
of the word <i>cadr</i> in the plural, both as to etymology and
original meaning of beautiful. It is a word in constant use in
Carnarvonshire, where it is ironically applied to pretentious men fond
of showing themselves off, especially in the matter of clothes.
<i>&rsquo;D ydi nhw &rsquo;n geiri!</i> &lsquo;Aren&rsquo;t they
swells!&rsquo; <i>Dyna i ch&rsquo;i gawr!</i> &lsquo;There&rsquo;s a
fine fellow for you!&rsquo; and so also with the feminine
<i>cawres</i>. Of course the <i>cawr</i> of standard Welsh is familiar
enough in the sense of giant to Carnarvonshire people, so the meaning
can be best ascertained in the case of the plural <i>ceiri</i>, which
they hardly ever meet with in print; and, so far as I have been able to
ascertain, by <i>ceiri</i> they mean&mdash;in an ironical sense it is
true&mdash;fine fellows, with reference not to great stature or
strength but to their get-up. Thus one arrives at the true
interpretation of the name <i>Tre&rsquo;r Ceiri</i> as the Town of the
<i>Prydyn</i> or <i>Cruithni</i>; that is to say, the Town of the Picts
or the Aborigines, who showed themselves off decorated with pictures.
So far also from <i>Ynys y Ceiri</i> being an echo of <i>Ynys y
Cedyrn</i>, it turns out to be really the more original of the two.
Such names, when they are closely examined, are apt to prove old beyond
all hastily formed expectation. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb284"

excessive fondness for our Arthur English people translate this name
into Arthur&rsquo;s Seat instead of Idris&rsquo; Seat; but Idris was
also somebody: he was a giant with a liking for the study of the stars.
But let that be: I wish to say a word concerning his name: Idris may be
explained as meaning &lsquo;War-champion,&rsquo; or the like; and,
phonologically speaking, it comes from <i lang="cy">Iu&#273;-rys</i>,
which was made successively into <i lang="cy">Id-rys</i>, <i>Idris</i>.
The syllable <i lang="cy">i&#813;u&#273;</i> meant battle or fight, and
it undergoes a variety of forms in Welsh names. Thus before <i>n</i>,
<i>r</i>, <i>l</i>, and <i>w</i>, it becomes <i>id</i>, as in
<i>Idnerth</i>, <i>Idloes</i>, and <i>Idwal</i>, while <i lang=
"cy">Iu&#273;-hael</i> yields <i>Ithel</i>, whence Ab Ithel, anglicized
<i>Bethel</i>. At the end, however, it is <i lang="cy">y&#273;</i> or
<i>u&#273;</i>, as in <i lang="cy">Gruffu&#273;</i> or <i lang=
"cy">Gruffy&#273;</i>, from Old Welsh <i lang=

<i lang="cy">Meredy&#273;</i> for an older <i lang=

the poets write <i lang="cy">u&#273;</i>, and understand to mean
<i>lord</i>; but if these forms are related, it must have originally
meant rather a fighter, soldier, or champion.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow"

<i lang="cy">Cwta</i> makes <i>cota</i> in the feminine in North
Cardiganshire; the word is nevertheless only the English <i>cutty</i>
borrowed. <i>Du</i>, &lsquo;black,&rsquo; has corresponding to it in
Irish, <i lang="ga">dubh</i>. So the Welsh word seems to have passed
through the stages <i>dyv</i>, <i>dyw</i>, before <i>yw</i> was
contracted into <i>&ucirc;</i>, which was formerly pronounced like
French <i>&ucirc;</i>, as proved by the grammar already mentioned (p.
22) of J. D. Rhys, published in London in 1592; see p. 33, to which my
attention has been called by Prof. J. Morris Jones. In Old or
pre-Norman Welsh <i>m</i> did duty for <i>m</i> and <i>v</i>, so one
detects <i>dyv</i> as <i>dim</i> in a woman&rsquo;s name
<i>Penardim</i>, &lsquo;she of the very black head&rsquo;; there was
also a <i>Penarwen</i>, &lsquo;she of the very blonde head.&rsquo; The
look of <i>Penardim</i> having baffled the redactor of the
<i>Branwen</i>, he left the spelling unchanged: see the (Oxford)
<i>Mabinogion</i>, p. 26. The same sort of change which produced
<i>du</i> has produced <i>cnu</i>, &lsquo;a fleece,&rsquo; as compared
with <i>cneifio</i>, &lsquo;to fleece&rsquo;; <i lang=
"cy">&#7931;uarth</i>, &lsquo;a kitchen garden,&rsquo; as compared with
its Irish equivalent <i lang="ga">lubhghort</i>. Compare also <i lang=
"cy">Rhiwabon</i>, locally pronounced <i lang="cy">Rhuabon</i>, and
<i lang="cy">Rhiwa&#7931;on</i>, occurring sometimes as <i lang=
"cy">Rhua&#7931;on</i>. But the most notable r&ocirc;le of this
phonetic process is exemplified by the verbal nouns ending in <i>u</i>,
such as <i lang="cy">caru</i>, &lsquo;to love,&rsquo; <i lang=
"cy">credu</i>, &lsquo;to believe,&rsquo; <i lang="cy">tyngu</i>,
&lsquo;to swear,&rsquo; in which the <i>u</i> corresponds to an
<i>m</i> termination in Old Irish, as in <i lang="cy">sechem</i>,
&lsquo;to follow,&rsquo; <i lang="cy">cretem</i>, &lsquo;belief,&rsquo;

the writer seems to have been puzzled by the <i>mh</i> of
A<i>mh</i>eirchion, and to have argued back to a radical form
<i>Parch</i>; but he was on the wrong tack&mdash;<i>Amheirchion</i>
comes from <i>Ap-Meirchion</i>, where the <i>p</i> helped to make the
<i>m</i> a surd, which, with the syllabic accent on the succeeding
vowel, became fixed as <i>mh</i>, while the <i>p</i> disappeared by
assimilation. We have, later on, a similar instance in <i lang=
"cy">Owen y Mhaxen</i> for Owen Amhacsen = O. ap Macsen. Another
instance will be found at the opening of the <i>Mabinogi</i> of
Branwen, to wit, in the word <i lang="cy">prynhawngweith</i>,
&lsquo;once on an afternoon,&rsquo; from <i lang="cy">prynhawn</i>,
&lsquo;afternoon,&rsquo; for which our dictionaries substitute <i lang=
"cy">prydnawn</i>, with the accent on the ultima, though D. ab Gwilym
used <i lang="cy">pyrnhawn</i>, as in poem xl. 30. But the ordinary
pronunciation continues to be <i lang="cy">prynh&aacute;wn</i> or
<i lang="cy">pyrnh&aacute;wn</i>, sometimes reduced in Gwyne&#273; to
<i lang="cy">pnawn</i>. Let me add an instance which has reached me
since writing the above: In the <i lang="la">Arch&aelig;ologia
Cambrensis</i> for 1899, pp. 325&ndash;6, we have the pedigree of the
<i>Ameridiths</i> from the Visitation of Devonshire in 1620: in the
course of it one finds that Iuan ap Merydeth has a son Thomas
<i>Amerideth</i>, who, knowing probably no Welsh, took to writing his
patronymic more nearly as it was pronounced. The line is brought down
to Ames <i>Amerideth</i>, who was created baronet in 1639.
<i>Amerideth</i> of course = Ap Meredy&#273;, and the present member of
the family who writes to the <i lang="la">Arch&aelig;ologia
Cambrensis</i> spells his patronymic more correctly, <i>Ameridith</i>;
but if it had survived in Wales it might have been
<i>Amheredy&#273;</i>. For an older instance than any of these see the
<i>Book of Taliessin</i>, poem xlix (= Skene, ii. 204), where one reads
of <i lang="cy">Beli Amhanogan</i>, &lsquo;B. ab

This is pronounced <i lang="cy">Rhiwan</i>, though probably made up of
Rhiw-wen, for it is the tendency of the Gwyndodeg to convert <i>e</i>

<i>e</i> in Glamorgan; see such instances as <i>Cornwan</i> and

name means the Bridge of the Blessed Ford, but how the ford came to be
so called I know not. The word <i lang="cy">bendigaid</i>,

objection to <i lang="cy">n&#273;</i> in book Welsh, be <i lang=

&lsquo;the Leaves of the Blessed&rsquo; (in the feminine singular

<i lang="cy">dyn hyspys</i> in Glamorgan means now, as a rule,
&lsquo;economical&rsquo; or &lsquo;thrifty,&rsquo; but in this instance
it would seem to have signified &lsquo;shrewd,&rsquo;
&lsquo;cunning,&rsquo; or &lsquo;clever,&rsquo; though it would
probably come nearer the original meaning of the word to render it by
&lsquo;smart,&rsquo; for it is in Irish <i lang="ga">conduail</i>,
which is found applied to ingenious work, such as the ornamentation on
the hilt of a sword. Another term for a wizard or conjurer is <i lang=
"cy">gwr cyfarwy&#273;</i>, with which the reader is already familiar.
Here <i lang="cy">cyfarwy&#273;</i> forms a link with the <i lang=
"cy">kyvar&#7933;yd</i> of the <i>Mabinogion</i>, where it usually
means a professional man, especially one skilled in story and history;
and what constituted his knowledge was called <i lang=
"cy">kyvar&#7933;ydyt</i>, which included, among other things,
acquaintance with boundaries and pedigrees, but it meant most
frequently perhaps story; see the (Oxford) <i>Mabinogion</i>, pp. 5,
61, 72, 93. All these terms should, strictly speaking, have <i lang=
"cy">gwr</i>&mdash;<i lang="cy">gwr hyspys</i>, <i lang="cy">gwr
cynnil</i>, and <i lang="cy">gwr cyfarwy&#273;</i>&mdash;but for the
fact that modern Welsh tends to restrict <i lang="cy">gwr</i> to
signify &lsquo;a husband&rsquo; or &lsquo;a married man,&rsquo; while
<i lang="cy">dyn</i>, which only signifies a <i>mortal</i>, is made to
mean man, and provided with a feminine <i lang="cy">dynes</i>,
&lsquo;woman,&rsquo; unknown to good Welsh literature. Thus the spoken

Another word for the <i lang="cy">toeli</i> is given by Silvan Evans as
used in certain parts of South Wales, namely, <i lang="cy">tolaeth</i>
or <i lang="cy">dolath</i>, as to which he <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb274n" href="#pb274n" name=

<i lang="cy">tylwyth</i>, a view corroborated by Howells using, p. 31,
the plural <i lang="cy">tyloethod</i>; but it could not be easily
explained except as a corruption through the medium of English. Elias
Owen, p. 303, uses the word in reference to the hammering and rapping
noise attending the joinering of a phantom coffin for a man about to
die, a sort of rehearsal well known throughout the Principality to
every one who has ears spiritually tuned. Unfortunately I have not yet
succeeded in locating the use of the word <i lang="cy">tolaeth</i>,
except that I have been assured by a Carmarthen man that it is current
in Welsh there as <i lang="cy">toleth</i>, and by a native of Pumsant

<i>Cadarn</i> and <i>cadr</i> postulate respectively some such early
forms as <i>cat&#7771;no-s</i> and <i>cadro-s</i>, which according to
analogy should become <i>cadarn</i> and <i>ca&#273;r</i>. Welsh,
however, is not fond of <i>&#273;r</i>; so here begins a bifurcation:
(1) retaining the <i>d</i> unchanged <i>cadro-s</i> yields <i>cadr</i>,
or (2) <i>dr</i> is made into <i>&#273;r</i>, and other changes set in
resulting in the <i>ceir</i> of <i>ceiri</i>, as in Welsh
<i>aneirif</i>, &lsquo;numberless,&rsquo; from <i>eirif</i>,
&lsquo;number,&rsquo; of the same origin as Irish <i>&aacute;ram</i>
from *<i>a&#273;-rim</i> = *<i>ad-r&#299;m&#257;</i>, and Welsh
<i>eiliw</i>, &lsquo;<i>species</i>, colour,&rsquo; for
<i>a&#273;-liw</i>, in both of which <i>i</i> follows <i>&#273;</i>
combinations; but that is not essential, as shown by <i>cader</i>,
<i>cadair</i>, for Old Welsh <i>cateir</i>, &lsquo;a chair,&rsquo; from
Latin <i>cat[h]edra</i>. The word that serves as our singular, namely
<i>cawr</i>, is far harder to explain; but on the whole I am inclined
to regard it as of a different origin, to wit, the Goidelic word
<i>caur</i>, &lsquo;a giant or hero,&rsquo; borrowed. The plural
<i>cewri</i> or <i>cawri</i> is formed from the singular <i>cawr</i>,
which means a giant, though, associated in the plural with
<i>ceiri</i>, it has sometimes to follow suit with that vocable in
connoting dress.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

</div>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The following paper exhausts no part of the subject:
it simply embodies the substance of my notes of conversations which I
have had with Manx men and Manx women, whose names, together with such
other particulars as I could get, are in my possession. I have mostly
avoided reading up the subject in printed books; but those who wish to
see it exhaustively treated may be directed to Mr. Arthur W.
Moore&rsquo;s book on <i>The Folklore of the Isle of Man</i>, to which
may now be added Mr. C. Roeder&rsquo;s <i>Contributions to the Folklore
of the Isle of Man</i> in the <i>Lioar Manninagh</i> for 1897, pp.
129&ndash;91.</p>
<p>For the student of folklore the Isle of Man is very fairly stocked
with inhabitants of the imaginary order. She has her fairies and her
giants, her mermen and brownies, her kelpies and water-bulls.</p>
<p>The water-bull or <i>tarroo ushtey</i>, as he is called in Manx, is
a creature about which I have not been able to learn much, but he is
described as a sort of bull disporting himself about the pools and
swamps. For instance, I was told at the village of Andreas, in the flat
country forming the northern end of the island, and known as
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb285" href="#pb285" name=
"pb285">285</a>]</span>the Ayre, that there used to be a <i>tarroo
ushtey</i> between Andreas and the sea to the west: it was before the
ground had been drained as it is now. And an octogenarian captain at
Peel related to me how he had once when a boy heard a <i>tarroo
ushtey</i>: the bellowings of the brute made the ground tremble, but
otherwise the captain was unable to give me any very intelligible
description. This bull is by no means of the same breed as the bull
that comes out of the lakes of Wales to mix with the farmers&rsquo;
cattle, for there the result used to be great fertility among the
stock, and an overflow of milk and dairy produce, but in the Isle of
Man the <i>tarroo ushtey</i> only begets monsters and strangely formed
beasts.</p>
<p>The kelpie, or, rather, what I take to be a kelpie, was called by my
informants a <i>glashtyn</i>; and Kelly, in his <i>Manx Dictionary</i>,
describes the object meant as &lsquo;a goblin, an imaginary animal
which rises out of the water.&rsquo; One or two of my informants
confused the glashtyn with the Manx brownie. On the other hand, one of
them was very definite in his belief that it had nothing human about
it, but was a sort of grey colt, frequenting the banks of lakes at
night, and never seen except at night.</p>
<p>Mermen and mermaids disport themselves on the coasts of Man, but I
have to confess that I have made no careful inquiry into what is
related about them; and my information about the giants of the island
is equally scanty. To confess the truth, I do not recollect hearing of
more than one giant, but that <i>was</i> a giant: I have seen the marks
of his huge hands impressed on the top of two massive monoliths. They
stand in a field at Balla Keeill Pherick, on the way down from the Sloc
to Colby. I was told there were originally five of these stones
standing in a circle, all of them marked in the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb286" href="#pb286" name="pb286">286</a>]</span>same
way by the same giant as he hurled them down there from where he stood,
miles away on the top of the mountain called Cronk yn Irree Laa. Here I
may mention that the Manx word for a giant is <i>foawr</i>, in which a
vowel-flanked <i>m</i> has been spirited away, as shown by the modern
Irish spelling, <i>fomhor</i>. This, in the plural in old Irish,
appears as the name of the <i>Fomori</i>, so well known in Irish
legend, which, however, does not always represent them as giants, but
rather as monsters. I have been in the habit of explaining the word as
meaning <i>submarini</i>; but no more are they invariably connected
with the sea. So another etymology recommends itself, namely, one which
comes from Dr. Whitley Stokes, and makes the <i>mor</i> in
<i>fomori</i> to be of the same origin as the <i>mare</i> in the
English night<i>mare</i>, French cauche<i>mar</i>, German <i>mahr</i>,
&lsquo;an elf,&rsquo; and cognate words. I may mention that with the
Fomori of mythic origin have doubtless been confounded and identified
certain invaders of Ireland, especially the Dumnonians from the country
between Galloway and the mouth of the Clyde, some of whom may be
inferred to have coasted the north of Ireland and landed in the west,
for example in Erris, the north-west of Mayo, called after them
<i>Irrus</i> (or Erris) <i>Domnann</i>.</p>
<p>The Manx brownie is called the <i>fenodyree</i>, and he is described
as a hairy and apparently clumsy fellow, who would, for instance,
thrash a whole barnful of corn in a single night for the people to whom
he felt well disposed; and once on a time he undertook to bring down
for the farmer his wethers from Snaefell. When the fenodyree had safely
put them in an outhouse, he said that he had some trouble with the
little ram, as it had run three times round Snaefell that morning. The
farmer did not quite understand him, but on going to look at the sheep,
he found, to his infinite surprise, that <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb287" href="#pb287" name="pb287">287</a>]</span>the little ram was no
other than a hare, which, poor creature, was dying of fright and
fatigue. I need scarcely point out the similarity between this and the
story of Peredur, who, as a boy, drove home two hinds with his
mother&rsquo;s goats from the forest: he owned to having had some
trouble with the goats that had so long run wild as to have lost their
horns, a circumstance which had greatly impressed him<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e12506src" href="#xd25e12506" name="xd25e12506src">1</a>. To
return to the fenodyree, I am not sure that there were more than one in
Man&mdash;I have never heard him spoken of in the plural; but two
localities at least are assigned to him, namely, a farm called
Ballachrink, in Colby, in the south, and a farm called Lanjaghan, in
the parish of Conchan, near Douglas. Much the same stories, however,
appear to be current about him in the two places, and one of the most
curious of them is that which relates how he left. The farmer so valued
the services of the fenodyree, that one day he took it into his head to
provide clothing for him. The fenodyree examined each article
carefully, and expressed his idea of it, and specified the kind of
disease it was calculated to produce. In a word, he found that the
clothes would make head and foot sick, and he departed in disgust,
saying to the farmer, &lsquo;Though this place is thine, the great glen
of Rushen is not.&rsquo; Glen Rushen is one of the most retired glens
in the island, and it drains down through Glen Meay to the coast, some
miles to the south of Peel. It is to Glen Rushen, then, that the
fenodyree is supposed to be gone; but on visiting that valley in
1890<a class="noteref" id="xd25e12518src" href="#xd25e12518" name=
"xd25e12518src">2</a> in quest of Manx-speaking peasants, I could find
nobody there who knew anything of him. I suspect that the spread
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb288" href="#pb288" name=
"pb288">288</a>]</span>of the English language even there has forced
him to leave the island altogether. Lastly, with regard to the term
<i>fenodyree</i>, I may mention that it is the word used in the Manx
Bible of 1819 for <i>satyr</i> in Isaiah xxxiv. 14<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e12530src" href="#xd25e12530" name="xd25e12530src">3</a>, where
we read in the English Bible as follows: &lsquo;The wild beasts of the
desert shall also meet with the wild beasts of the island, and the
satyr shall cry to his fellow.&rsquo; In the Vulgate the latter clause
reads: <i lang="la">et pilosus clamabit alter ad alterum</i>. The term
<i>fenodyree</i> has been explained by Cregeen in his <i>Manx
Dictionary</i> to mean one who has hair for stockings or hose. That
answers to the description of the hairy satyr, and seems fairly well to
satisfy the phonetics of the case, the words from which he derives the
compound being <i>fynney</i><a class="noteref" id="xd25e12557src" href=
"#xd25e12557" name="xd25e12557src">4</a>, &lsquo;hair,&rsquo; and
<i>oashyr</i>, &lsquo;a stocking&rsquo;; but as <i>oashyr</i> seems to
come from the old Norse <i>hosur</i>, the plural of <i>hosa</i>,
&lsquo;<i>hose</i> or stocking,&rsquo; the term <i>fenodyree</i> cannot
date before the coming of the Norsemen; and I am inclined to think the
idea more Teutonic than Celtic. At any rate I need not point out to the
English reader the counterparts of this hairy satyr in the hobgoblin
&lsquo;Lob lie by the Fire,&rsquo; and Milton&rsquo;s &lsquo;Lubber
Fiend,&rsquo; whom he describes as one that</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Basks at the fire his hairy strength,</p>
<p class="line">And crop-full out of doors he flings,</p>
<p class="line">Ere the first cock his matin rings.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Lastly, I may mention that Mr. Roeder has a great deal
to say about the fenodyree under the name of glashtyn; for it is
difficult to draw any hard and fast <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb289" href="#pb289" name="pb289">289</a>]</span>line between the
glashtyn and the fenodyree, or even the water-bull, so much alike do
they seem to have been regarded. Mr. Roeder&rsquo;s items of folklore
concerning the glashtyns (see the <i>Lioar Manninagh</i>, iii. 139)
show that there were male and female glashtyns, and that the former
were believed to have been too fond of the women at Ballachrink, until
one evening some of the men, dressed as women, arranged to receive some
youthful glashtyns. Whether the fenodyree is of Norse origin or not,
the glashtyn is decidedly Celtic, as will be further shown in chapter
vii. Here it will suffice to mention one or two related words which are
recorded in Highland Gaelic, namely, <i>glaistig</i>, &lsquo;a
she-goblin which assumes the form of a goat,&rsquo; and
<i>glaisrig</i>, &lsquo;a female fairy or a goblin, half human, half
beast.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The fairies claim our attention next, and as the only other fairies
tolerably well known to me are those of Wales, I can only compare or
contrast the Manx fairies with the Welsh ones. They are called in Manx,
<i>sleih beggey</i>, or little people, and <i>ferrishyn</i>, from the
English word <i>fairies</i>, as it would seem. Like the Welsh fairies,
they kidnap babies; and I have heard it related how a woman in Dalby
had a struggle with the fairies over her baby, which they were trying
to drag out of the bed from her. Like Welsh fairies, also, they take
possession of the hearth after the farmer and his family are gone to
bed. A man in Dalby used to find them making a big fire in his kitchen:
he would hear the crackling and burning of the fire when nobody else
<i>could</i> have been there except the fairies and their friends. I
said &lsquo;friends,&rsquo; for they sometimes take a man with them,
and allow him to eat with them at the expense of others. Thus, some men
from the northern-most parish, Kirk Bride, went once on a time to Port
Erin, in the south, to buy a supply of fish for the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb290" href="#pb290" name=
"pb290">290</a>]</span>winter, and with them went a Kirk Michael man
who had the reputation of being a <i>persona grata</i> to the fairies.
Now one of the Port Erin men asked a man from the north who the Michael
man might be: he was curious to know his name, as he had seen him once
before, and on that occasion the Michael man was with the fairies at
his house&mdash;the Port Erin man&rsquo;s house&mdash;helping himself
to bread and cheese in company with the rest. As the fairies were
regaling themselves in this instance on ordinary bread and cheese at a
living Manxman&rsquo;s expense, the story may perhaps be regarded as
not inconsistent with one mentioned by Cumming<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e12651src" href="#xd25e12651" name="xd25e12651src">5</a> to the
following effect:&mdash;A man attracted one night as he was crossing
the mountains, by fairy music, entered a fairy hall where a banquet was
going on. He noticed among them several faces which he seemed to know,
but no act of mutual recognition took place till he had some drink
offered him, when one of those whom he seemed to know warned him not to
taste of the drink if he had any wish to make his way home again. If he
partook of it he would become like one of them. So he found an
opportunity for spilling it on the ground and securing the cup;
whereupon the hall and all its inmates instantaneously vanished. On
this I may remark that it appears to have been a widely spread belief,
that no one who had partaken of the food for spirits would be allowed
to return to his former life, and some instances will be found
mentioned by Professor Tylor in his <i>Primitive Culture</i>, ii.
50&ndash;2.</p>
<p>Like the Welsh fairies, the Manx ones take men away with them and
detain them for years. Thus a Kirk Andreas man was absent from his
people for four years, which he spent with the fairies. He could not
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb291" href="#pb291" name=
"pb291">291</a>]</span>tell how he returned, but it seemed as if,
having been unconscious, he woke up at last in this world. The other
world, however, in which he was for the four years was not far away, as
he could see what his brothers and the rest of the family were doing
every day, although they could not see him. To prove this, he mentioned
to them how they were occupied on such and such a day, and, among other
things, how they took their corn on a particular day to Ramsey. He
reminded them also of their having heard a sudden sharp crack as they
were passing by a thorn bush he named, and how they were so startled
that one of them would have run back home. He asked them if they
remembered that, and they said they did, only too well. He then
explained to them the meaning of the noise, namely, that one of the
fairies with whom he had been galloping the whole time was about to let
fly an arrow at his brothers, but that as he was going to do this, he
(the missing brother) raised a plate and intercepted the arrow: that
was the sharp noise they had heard. Such was the account he had to give
of his sojourn in Faery. This representation of the world of the
fairies, as contained within the ordinary world of mortals, is very
remarkable; but it is not a new idea, as we seem to detect it in the
Irish story of the abduction of Conla R&uacute;ad<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e12667src" href="#xd25e12667" name="xd25e12667src">6</a>: the
fairy who comes to fetch him tells him that the folk of Tethra, whom
she represents, behold him every day as he takes part in the assemblies
of his country and sits among his friends. The commoner way of putting
it is simply to represent the fairies as invisible to mortals at will;
and one kind of Welsh story relates how the mortal midwife accidentally
touches her eyes, while dressing a fairy baby, with an ointment which
makes the fairy world visible to her: see pp. 63, 213, above.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb292" href="#pb292" name=
"pb292">292</a>]</span></p>
<p>Like Welsh fairies, the Manx ones had, as the reader will have seen,
horses to ride; they had also dogs, just as the Welsh ones had. This I
learn from another story, to the effect that a fisherman, taking a
fresh fish home, was pursued by a pack of fairy dogs, so that it was
only with great trouble he reached his own door. Then he picked up a
stone and threw it at the dogs, which at once disappeared; but he did
not escape, as he was shot by the fairies, and so hurt that he lay ill
for fully six months from that day. He would have been left alone by
the fairies, I was told, if he had only taken care to put a pinch of
salt in the fish&rsquo;s mouth before setting out, for the Manx fairies
cannot stand salt or baptism. So children that have been baptized are,
as in Wales, less liable to be kidnapped by these elves than those that
have not. I scarcely need add that a twig of <i>cuirn</i><a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e12678src" href="#xd25e12678" name=
"xd25e12678src">7</a> or rowan is also as effective against fairies in
Man as it is in Wales. Manx fairies seem to have been musical, like
their kinsmen elsewhere; for I have heard of an Orrisdale man crossing
the neighbouring mountains at night and hearing fairy music, which took
his fancy so much that he listened, and tried to remember it. He had,
however, to return, it is said, three times to the place before he
could carry it away complete in his mind, which he succeeded in doing
at <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb293" href="#pb293" name=
"pb293">293</a>]</span>last just as the day was breaking and the
musicians disappearing. This air, I am told, is now known by the name
of the <i>Bollan Bane</i>, or White Wort. As to certain Welsh airs
similarly supposed to have been derived from the fairies, see pages
201&ndash;2 above.</p>
<p>So far I have pointed out next to nothing but similarities between
Manx fairies and Welsh ones, and I find very little indicative of a
difference. First, with regard to salt, I am unable to say anything in
this direction, as I do not happen to know how Welsh fairies regard
salt: it is not improbable that they eschew salt as well as baptism,
especially as the Church of Rome has long associated salt with baptism.
There is, however, one point, at least, of difference between the
fairies of Man and of Wales: the latter are, so far as I can call to
mind, never supposed to discharge arrows at men or women, or to handle
a bow<a class="noteref" id="xd25e12735src" href="#xd25e12735" name=
"xd25e12735src">8</a> at all, whereas Manx fairies are always ready to
shoot. May we, therefore, provisionally regard this trait of the Manx
fairies as derived from a Teutonic source? At any rate English and
Scotch elves were supposed to shoot, and I am indebted to the kindness
of my colleague, Professor Napier, for calling my attention to the
<i>Leechdoms of Early England</i><a class="noteref" id="xd25e12740src"
href="#xd25e12740" name="xd25e12740src">9</a> for cases in point.</p>
<p>Now that most of the imaginary inhabitants of Man and its coasts
have been rapidly passed in review before the reader, I may say
something of others whom I regard as semi-imaginary&mdash;real human
beings to whom impossible attributes are ascribed: I mean chiefly the
witches, or, as they are sometimes called in Manx <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb294" href="#pb294" name=
"pb294">294</a>]</span>English, <i>butches</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e12749src" href="#xd25e12749" name="xd25e12749src">10</a>. That
term I take to be a variant of the English word <i>witch</i>, produced
under the influence of the verb <i>bewitch</i>, which was reduced in
Manx English to a form <i>butch</i>, especially if one bear in mind the
Cumbrian and Scottish pronunciation of these words, as <i>wutch</i> and
<i>bewutch</i>. Now witches shift their form, and I have heard of one
old witch changing herself into a pigeon; but that I am bound to regard
as exceptional, the regular form into which Manx witches pass at their
pleasure being that of the hare, and such a swift and thick skinned
hare that no greyhound, except a black one without a single white hair,
can catch it, and no shot, except a silver coin, penetrate its body.
Both these peculiarities are also well known in Wales. I notice a
difference, however, between Wales and Man with regard to the hare
witches: in Wales only the women can become hares, and this property
runs, so far as I know, in certain families. I have known many such,
and my own nurse belonged to one of them, so that my mother was
reckoned to be rather reckless in entrusting me to <i>y Gota</i>, or
&lsquo;the Cutty One,&rsquo; as she might run away at any moment,
leaving her charge to take care of itself. But I have never heard of
any man or boy of any such family turning himself into a hare, whereas
in the Isle of Man the hare witches may belong, if I may say so, to
either sex. I am not sure, however, that a man who turns himself into a
hare would be called a wizard or witch; and I recollect hearing in the
neighbourhood of Ramsey of a man nicknamed the <i>gaaue mwaagh</i>,
that is to say, &lsquo;the hare smith,&rsquo; the reason being that
this particular smith now and then assumed the form of a hare. I am not
quite sure that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb295" href="#pb295"
name="pb295">295</a>]</span><i>gaaue mwaagh</i> is the name of a class,
though I rather infer that it is. If so, it must be regarded as a
survival of the magic skill associated with smiths in ancient Ireland,
as evidenced, for instance, in St. Patrick&rsquo;s Hymn in the eleventh
or twelfth century manuscript at Trinity College, Dublin, known as the
<i>Liber Hymnorum</i>, in which we have a prayer&mdash;</p>

<p class="first">The persons who had the power of turning themselves
into hares were believed to be abroad and very active, together with
the whole demon world, on the eve of May-day of the Old Style. And a
middle-aged man from the parish of Andreas related to me how he came
three or four times across a woman reputed to be a witch, carrying on
her evil practices at the junction of cross-roads, or the meeting of
three boundaries. This happened once very early on Old May morning, and
afterwards he met her several times as he was returning home from
visiting his sweetheart. He warned the witch that if he found her again
he would kick her: that is what he tells me. Well, after a while he did
surprise her again at work at four cross-roads, somewhere near Lezayre.
She had a circle, he said, as large as that made by horses in
threshing, swept clean around her. He kicked her and took away her
besom, which he hid till the middle of the day. Then he made the farm
boys fetch some dry gorse, and he put the witch&rsquo;s besom on the
top of it. Thereupon fire was set to the gorse, and, wonderful to
relate, the besom, as it burned, crackled and made reports like guns
going off. In fact, the noise could be heard at Andreas
Church&mdash;that is to say, miles away. The <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb296" href="#pb296" name=
"pb296">296</a>]</span>besom had on it &lsquo;seventeen sorts of
knots,&rsquo; he stated, and the woman herself ought to have been
burned: in fact, he added that she did not long survive her besom. The
man who related this to me is hale and strong, living now in the parish
of Michael, and not in that of Andreas, where he was born.</p>
<p>There is a tradition at St. John&rsquo;s, which is overlooked by the
mountain called Slieau Whallian, that witches used at one time to be
punished by being set to roll down the steep side of the mountain in
spiked barrels; but, short of putting them to death, there were various
ways of rendering the machinations of witches innocuous, or of undoing
the mischief done by them; for the charmers supply various means of
meeting them triumphantly, and in case an animal is the victim, the
burning of it always proves an effective means of bringing the offender
to book: I shall have occasion to return to this under another heading.
There is a belief that if you can draw blood, however little, from a
witch, or one who has the evil eye, he loses his power of harming you;
and I have been told that formerly this belief was sometimes acted
upon. Thus, on leaving church, for instance, the man who fancied
himself in danger from another would sidle up to him or walk by his
side, and inflict on him a slight scratch, or some other trivial wound,
which elicited blood; but this must have been a course always attended
with more or less danger.</p>
<p>The persons able to undo the witches&rsquo; work, and remove the
malignant influence of the evil eye, are known in Manx English as
charmers, and something must now be said of them. They have various
ways of proceeding to their work. A lady of about thirty-five, living
at Peel, related to me how, when she was a child suffering from a
swelling in the neck, she had it charmed <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb297" href="#pb297" name="pb297">297</a>]</span>away by an old woman.
This charmer brought with her no less than nine pieces of iron,
consisting of bits of old pokers, old nails, and other odds and ends of
the same metal, making in all nine pieces. After invoking the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Ghost, she began to rub the girl&rsquo;s neck
with the old irons; nor was she satisfied with that, for she rubbed the
doors, the walls, and the furniture likewise, with the metal. The
result, I was assured, was highly satisfactory, as she has never been
troubled with a swelling in the throat since that day. Sometimes a
passage from the Bible is made use of in charming, as, for instance, in
the case of bleeding. One of the verses then pronounced is Ezekiel xvi.
6, which runs thus:&mdash;&lsquo;And when I passed by thee, and saw
thee polluted in thine own blood, I said unto thee when thou wast in
thy blood, Live; yea, I said unto thee when thou wast in thy blood,
Live.&rsquo; This was told me by a Laxey man, who is over seventy years
of age. The methods of charming away warts are various. A woman from
the neighbourhood of St. John&rsquo;s explained to me how a charmer
told her to get rid of the warts on her hands. She was to take a string
and make a knot on it for every wart she had, and then tie the string
round her hand, or fingers&mdash;I forget which; and I think my
informant, on her part, forgot to tell me a vital part of the formula,
namely, that the string was to be destroyed. But however that may be,
she assured me that the warts disappeared, and have never returned
since. A lady at Andreas has a still simpler method of getting rid of
warts. She rubs a snail on the warts, and then places the snail on one
of the points of a blackthorn, and, in fact, leaves the snail to die,
transfixed by the thorn; and as the snail dies the warts disappear. She
has done this in the case of her niece with complete success, so far as
the wart was concerned; but <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb298" href=
"#pb298" name="pb298">298</a>]</span>she had forgotten to notice
whether the snail had also succumbed.</p>
<p>The lady who in this case applied the remedy cannot be in any sense
called a charmer, however much one may insist on calling what she did a
charm. In fact, the term charmer tends to be associated with a
particular class of charm involving the use of herbs. Thus there used
to be at one time a famous charmer living near Kirk Michael, to whom
the fishermen were in the habit of resorting, and my informant told me
that he had been deputed more than once by his fellow fishermen to go
to him in consequence of their lack of success in the fishing. The
charmer gave him a packet of herbs, cut small, with directions that
they should be boiled, and the water mixed with some spirits&mdash;rum,
I think&mdash;and partly drunk in the boat by the captain and the crew,
and partly sprinkled over the boat and everything in it. The charmer
clearly defined his position in the matter to my informant. &lsquo;I
cannot,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;put the fish in your nets for you; but
if there is any mischief in the way of your luck, I can remove that for
you.&rsquo; The fishermen themselves had, however, more exaggerated
notions of the charmer&rsquo;s functions, for once on a time my
informant spent on drink for his boon companions the money which he was
to give the charmer, and then he collected herbs himself&mdash;it did
not much matter what herbs&mdash;and took them to his captain, who,
with the crew, went through the proper ritual, and made a most
successful haul that night. In fact, the only source of discontent was
the charmer&rsquo;s not having distributed the fish over two nights,
instead of endangering their nets by an excessive haul all in one
night. They regarded him as able to do almost anything he liked in the
matter.</p>
<p>A lady at Andreas gave me an account of a celebrated <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb299" href="#pb299" name=
"pb299">299</a>]</span>charmer who lived between there and the coast.
He worked on her husband&rsquo;s farm, but used to be frequently called
away to be consulted. He usually cut up wormwood for the people who
came to him, and if there was none to be had, he did not scruple to rob
the garden of any small sprouts it contained of cabbage or the like. He
would chop them small, and give directions about boiling them and
drinking the water. He usually charged any one leaving him to speak to
nobody on the way, lest he break the charm, and this mysteriousness was
evidently an important element in his profession. But he was,
nevertheless, a thriftless fellow, and when he went to Peel, and sent
the crier round to announce his arrival, and received a good deal of
money from the fishermen, he seldom so conducted himself as to bring
much of his earnings home. He died miserably some seven or eight years
ago at Ramsey, and left a widow in great poverty. As to the present
day, the daughter of a charmer now dead is married to a man living in a
village on the southern side of the island, and she appears to have
inherited her father&rsquo;s reputation for charming, as the fishermen
from all parts are said to flock to her for luck. Incidentally, I have
heard in the south more than once of her being consulted in cases of
sudden and dangerous illness, even after the best medical advice has
been obtained: in fact, she seems to have a considerable practice.</p>
<p>In answer to my question, how the charmer who died at Ramsey used to
give the sailors luck in the fishing, my informant at Andreas could not
say, except that he gave them herbs as already described, and she
thought also that he sold them wisps to place under their pillows. I
gather that the charms were chiefly directed to the removal of supposed
impediments to success in the fishing, rather than to any act of a more
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb300" href="#pb300" name=
"pb300">300</a>]</span>positive nature. So far as I have been able to
ascertain, charming is hereditary, and they say that it descends from
father to daughter, and then from daughter to son, and so on&mdash;a
remarkable kind of descent, on which I should be glad to learn the
opinion of anthropologists. One of the best Manx scholars in the island
related to me how some fishermen once insisted on his doing the charmer
for them because of his being of such and such a family, and how he
made fools of them. It is my impression that the charming families are
comparatively few in number, and this looks as if they descended from
the family physicians or druids of one or two chieftains in ancient
times. It is very likely a question which could be cleared up by a
local man familiar with the island and all that tradition has to say on
the subject of Manx pedigrees.</p>
<p>In the case of animals ailing, the herbs were also resorted to; and,
if the beasts happened to be milch cows, the herbs had to be boiled in
some of their milk. This was supposed to produce wonderful results,
described as follows by a man living at a place on the way from
Castletown up South Barrule:&mdash;A farmer in his parish had a cow
that milked blood, as he described it, and this in consequence of a
witch&rsquo;s ill-will. He went to the charmer, who gave him some
herbs, which he was to boil in the ailing cow&rsquo;s milk, and the
charmer charged him, whatever he did, not to quit the concoction while
it was on the fire, in spite of any noises he might hear. The farmer
went home and proceeded that night to boil the herbs as directed, but
he suddenly heard a violent tapping at the door, a terrible lowing of
the cattle in the cow-house, and stones coming down the
&lsquo;chumley&rsquo;: the end of it was that he suddenly fled and
sprang into bed to take shelter behind his wife. He went to the charmer
again, and related to him what <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb301"
href="#pb301" name="pb301">301</a>]</span>had happened: he was told
that he must have more courage the next time, unless he wished his cow
to die. He promised to do his best, and this time he stood his ground
in spite of the noises and the creaking of the windows&mdash;until, in
fact, a back window burst into pieces and bodily let a witch in, who
craved his pardon, and promised nevermore to molest him or his. This
all happened at the farm in question in the time of the present
farmer&rsquo;s grandfather. The boiling of the charmer&rsquo;s herbs in
milk always produces a great commotion and lowing among the cattle, and
it invariably cures the ailing ones: this is firmly believed by
respectable farmers whom I could name, in the north of the island in
particular, and I am alluding to men whom one might consider fairly
educated members of their class.</p>
<p>In the last mentioned instance not only is the requisite cure
effected, but the witch who caused the mischief is brought on the spot.
I have recently heard of a parallel to this in a belief which appears
to be still prevalent in the Channel Islands, more especially Guernsey.
The following incidents have been communicated to me by an ardent
folklorist, who has friends in the islands:&mdash;</p>
<p>An old woman in Torteval became ill, and her two sons were told that
if they tried one of the charms of divination, such as boiling certain
weeds in a pot, the first person to come to the house would prove to be
the one who had cast a spell over their mother. Accordingly they made
their <i>bouillederie</i>, and who should come to the door but a poor,
unoffending Breton onion seller, and as he was going away he was
waylaid by the two sons, who beat him within an inch of his life. They
were prosecuted and sentenced to terms of imprisonment; but the
charming did not come out in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb302"
href="#pb302" name="pb302">302</a>]</span>evidence, though it was
generally known to have been the reason for the assault. This account
was given my informant in 1898, and the incident appears to have
happened not very long before. Another is related thus:&mdash;A certain
family suffered from a plague of lice, which they regarded as the
consequence of a spell. They accordingly made their boiling of herbs
and looked for the first comer. He turned out to be a neighbour of
theirs who wished to buy some turnip seeds. The family abused him
roundly. He went away, but he was watched and caught by two of the sons
of the house, who beat him cruelly. They, on being prosecuted, had to
pay him &pound;5 damages. This took place in the summer of 1898, in the
narrator&rsquo;s own parish, in Guernsey. I have also another case of
recent date, to the effect that a young woman, whose churning was so
unsuccessful that the butter would not come, boiled herbs in the
prescribed way. She awaited the first comer, and, being engaged, her
intended husband was not unnaturally the first to arrive. She abused
him so unsparingly that he broke off the engagement. These instances go
far enough to raise the question why the boiling of herbs should be
supposed to bring the culprit immediately on the spot, but they hardly
go any further, namely, to help us to answer it.</p>
<p>Magic takes us back to a very primitive and loose manner of
thinking; so the marvellously easy way in which it identifies any tie
of association, however flimsy, with the insoluble bond of relationship
which educated men and women regard as connecting cause and effect,
renders even simpler means than I have described quite equal to the
undoing of the evils resulting from the activity of the evil eye. Thus,
let us suppose that a person endowed with the evil eye has just passed
by the farmer&rsquo;s herd of cattle, and a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb303" href="#pb303" name="pb303">303</a>]</span>calf
has suddenly been seized with a serious illness, the farmer hurries
after the man of the evil eye to get the dust from under his feet. If
he objects, the farmer may, as has sometimes been actually done, throw
him down by force, take off his shoes, and scrape off the dust adhering
to their soles, and carry it back to throw over the calf. Even that is
not always necessary, as it appears to be quite enough if he takes up
dust where he of the evil eye has just trod the ground. There are
innumerable cases on folk-record of both means proving entirely
efficacious, and they remind one of a story related in the <i lang=
"la">Itinerarium Kambri&aelig;</i>, i. 11, by Giraldus, as to the
archbishop when he was preaching in the neighbourhood of Haverfordwest.
A certain woman had lost her sight, but had so much faith in that holy
man that she sent her son to try and procure the least bit of the
fringe of his clothing. The youth, unable to make his way through the
crowd that surrounded the preacher, waited till it dispersed, and then
took home to his mother the sod on which he had stood and on which his
feet had left their mark. That earth was applied by her to her face and
eyes, with the result that she at once recovered her sight. A similar
question of psychology presents itself in a practice intended as a
preservative against the evil eye rather than as a cure. I allude to
what I have heard about two maiden ladies living in a Manx village
which I know very well: they are natives of a neighbouring parish, and
I am assured that whenever a stranger enters their house they proceed,
as soon as he goes away, to strew a little dust or sand over the spot
where he stood. That is understood to prevent any malignant influence
resulting from his visit. This tacit identifying of a man with his
footprints may be detected in a more precarious and pleasing form in a
quaint conceit <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb304" href="#pb304" name=
"pb304">304</a>]</span>familiar to me in the lyrics of rustic life in
Wales, when, for example, a coy maiden leaves her lovesick swain hotly
avowing his perfect readiness to <i>cusanu ol ei thraed</i>, that is,
to do on his knees all the stages of her path across the meadow,
kissing the ground wherever it has been honoured with the tread of her
dainty foot. Let me take another case, in which the cord of association
is not so inconceivably slender, namely, when two or more persons
standing in a close relation to one another are mistakenly treated a
little too much as if mutually independent, the objection is heard that
it matters not whether it is A or B, that it is, in fact, all the same,
as they belong to the same concern. In Welsh this is sometimes
expressed by saying, <i>Yr un yw Huw&rsquo;r Glyn a&rsquo;i glocs</i>,
that is, &lsquo;Hugh of the Glen and his clogs are all one.&rsquo;
Then, when you speak in English of a man &lsquo;standing in
another&rsquo;s shoes,&rsquo; I am by no means certain, that you are
not employing an expression which meant something more to those who
first used it than it does to us. Our modern idioms, with all their
straining after the abstract, are but primitive man&rsquo;s mental
tools adapted to the requirements of civilized life, and they often
retain traces of the form and shape which the neolithic worker&rsquo;s
chipping and polishing gave them.</p>
<p>It is difficult to arrange these scraps under any clearly classified
headings, and now that I have led the reader into the midst of matters
magical, perhaps I may just as well go on to the mention of a few more:
I alluded to the boiling of the herbs according to the charmer&rsquo;s
orders, with the result, among other things, of bringing the witch to
the spot. This is, however, not the only instance of the importance and
strange efficacy of fire. For when a beast dies on a farm, of course it
dies, according to the old-fashioned view of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb305" href="#pb305" name=
"pb305">305</a>]</span>things as I understand it, from the influence of
the evil eye or the interposition of a witch. So if you want to know to
whom you are indebted for the loss of the beast, you have simply to
burn its carcase in the open air and watch who comes first to the spot
or who first passes by: that is the criminal to be charged with the
death of the animal, and he cannot help coming there&mdash;such is the
effect of the fire. A Michael woman, who is now about thirty, related
to me how she watched while the carcase of a bewitched colt was
burning, how she saw the witch coming, and how she remembers her
shrivelled face, with nose and chin in close proximity. According to
another native of Michael, a well informed middle-aged man, the animal
in question was oftenest a calf, and it was wont to be burnt whole,
skin and all. The object, according to him, is invariably to bring the
bewitcher on the spot, and he always comes; but I am not clear what
happens to him when he appears. My informant added, however, that it
was believed that, unless the bewitcher got possession of the heart of
the burning beast, he lost all his power of bewitching. He related,
also, how his father and three other men were once out fishing on the
west coast of the island, when one of the three suddenly expressed his
wish to land. As they were fishing successfully some two or three miles
from the shore, they would not hear of it. He, however, insisted that
they must put him ashore at once, which made his comrades highly
indignant; but they soon had to give way, as they found that he was
determined to leap overboard unless they complied. When he got on shore
they watched him hurrying away towards where a beast was burning in the
corner of a field.</p>
<p>Manx stories merge this burning in a very perplexing fashion with
what may be termed a sacrifice for luck. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb306" href="#pb306" name="pb306">306</a>]</span>The following scraps
of information will make it clear what I mean:&mdash;A respectable
farmer from Andreas told me that he was driving with his wife to the
neighbouring parish of Jurby some years ago, and that on the way they
beheld the carcase of a cow or an ox burning in a field, with a woman
engaged in stirring the fire. On reaching the village to which they
were going, they found that the burning beast belonged to a farmer whom
they knew. They were further told it was no wonder that the said farmer
had one of his cattle burnt, as several of them had recently died.
Whether this was a case of sacrifice or not I cannot say. But let me
give another instance: a man whom I have already mentioned, saw at a
farm nearer the centre of the island a live calf being burnt. The owner
bears an English name, but his family has long been settled in Man. The
farmer&rsquo;s explanation to my informant was that the calf was burnt
to secure luck for the rest of the herd, some of which were threatening
to die. My informant thought there was absolutely nothing the matter
with them, except that they had too little food. Be that as it may, the
one calf was sacrificed as a burnt offering to secure luck for the rest
of the cattle. Let me here also quote Mr. Moore&rsquo;s note in his
<i>Manx Surnames</i>, p. 184, on the place-name <i>Cabbal yn Oural
Losht</i>, or the &lsquo;Chapel of the Burnt Sacrifice.&rsquo;
&lsquo;This name,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;records a circumstance which
took place in the nineteenth century, but which, it is to be hoped, was
never customary in the Isle of Man. A farmer, who had lost a number of
his sheep and cattle by murrain, burned a calf as a propitiatory
offering to the Deity on this spot, where a chapel was afterwards
built. Hence the name.&rsquo; Particulars, I may say, of time, place,
and person, could be easily added to Mr. Moore&rsquo;s statement,
excepting, perhaps, as to the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb307"
href="#pb307" name="pb307">307</a>]</span>deity in question: on that
point I have never been informed, but Mr. Moore was probably right in
the use of the capital <i>d</i>, as the sacrificer was, according to
all accounts, a devout Christian. I have to thank Sir Frederick Pollock
for calling my attention to a parallel this side of the sea: he refers
me to Worth&rsquo;s <i>History of Devonshire</i> (London, 1886), p.
339, where one reads the following singular
passage:&mdash;&lsquo;Living animals have been burnt alive in sacrifice
within memory to avert the loss of other stock. The burial of three
puppies &ldquo;brandise-wise&rdquo; in a field is supposed to rid it of
weeds.&rsquo; The second statement is very curious, and the first seems
to mean that preventive sacrifices have been performed in Devonshire
within the memory of men living in the author&rsquo;s time.</p>
<p>One more Manx instance: an octogenarian woman, born in the parish of
Bride, and now living at Kirk Andreas, saw, when she was a &lsquo;lump
of a girl&rsquo; of ten or fifteen years of age, a live sheep being
burnt in a field in the parish of Andreas, on May-day, whereby she
meant the first of May reckoned according to the Old Style. She
asserts<a class="noteref" id="xd25e12879src" href="#xd25e12879" name=
"xd25e12879src">12</a> very decidedly that it was <i>son oural</i>,
&lsquo;for a sacrifice,&rsquo; as she put it, and &lsquo;for an object
to the public&rsquo;: those were her words when she expressed herself
in English. Further, she made the statement that it was a custom to
burn a sheep on Old May-day for a sacrifice. I was fully alive to the
interest of this evidence, and cross-examined her so far as her age
allows of it, and I find that she adheres to her statement with all
firmness, but I distinguish two or three points in her evidence: 1. I
have no doubt that she saw, as she was passing by a certain field on
the borders of Andreas parish, a live sheep being burnt on <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb308" href="#pb308" name="pb308">308</a>]</span>Old
May-day. 2. But her statement that it was <i>son oural</i>, or as a
sacrifice, was probably only an inference drawn by her, possibly years
afterwards, on hearing things of the kind discussed. 3. Lastly, I am
convinced that she did hear the May-day sacrifice discussed, both in
Manx and in English: her words, &lsquo;for an object to the
public,&rsquo; are her imperfect recollection of a phrase used in her
hearing by somebody more ambitious of employing English abstract terms
than she is; and the formal nature of her statement in Manx, that it
was customary on May-day to burn as a sacrifice one head of sheep
(<i lang="gv">Laa Boaldyn va cliaghtey dy lostey son oural un baagh
keyrragh</i>), produces the same impression on my mind, that she is
only repeating somebody else&rsquo;s words. I mention this more
especially as I have failed to find anybody else in Andreas or Bride,
or indeed in the whole island, who will now confess to having ever
heard of the sheep sacrifice on Old May-day.</p>
<p>The time assigned to the sheep sacrifice, namely May-day, leads me
to make some remarks on the importance of that day among the Celts. The
day meant is, as I have already said, Old May-day, in Manx <i lang=
"gv">Shenn Laa Boaldyn</i>, the <i>belltaine</i> of Cormac&rsquo;s
<i>Glossary</i>, Scotch Gaelic <i>bealtuinn</i>. This was a day when
systematic efforts were made to protect man and beast against elves and
witches; for it was then that people carried crosses of rowan in their
hats and placed May flowers over the tops of their doors and elsewhere
as preservatives against all malignant influences. With the same object
in view crosses of rowan were likewise fastened to the tails of the
cattle, small crosses which had to be made without the help of a knife:
I exhibited a tiny specimen at one of the meetings of the Folk-Lore
Society. Early on May morning one went out to gather the dew as a thing
of great virtue, as in other <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb309" href=
"#pb309" name="pb309">309</a>]</span>countries. At Kirk Michael one
woman, who had been out on this errand years ago, told me that she
washed her face with the dew in order to secure luck, a good
complexion, and safety against witches. The break of this day is also
the signal for setting the ling or the gorse on fire, which is done in
order to burn out the witches wont to take the form of the hare; and
guns, I am told, were freely used to shoot any game met with on that
morning. With the proper charge some of the witches were now and then
hit and wounded, whereupon they resumed the human form and remained
cripples for the rest of their lives. Fire, however, appears to have
been the chief agency relied on to clear away the witches and other
malignant beings; and I have heard of this use of fire having been
carried so far that a practice was sometimes observed&mdash;as, for
example, in Lezayre&mdash;of burning gorse, however little, in the
hedge of each field on a farm in order to drive away the witches and
secure luck.</p>
<p>The man who told me this, on being asked whether he had ever heard
of cattle being driven through fire or between two fires on May-day,
replied that it was not known to him as a Manx custom, but that it was
an Irish one. A cattle-dealer whom he named used on May-day to drive
his cattle through fire so as to singe them a little, as he believed
that would preserve them from harm. He was an Irishman, who came to the
island for many years, and whose children are settled in the island
now. On my asking him if he knew whence the dealer came, he answered,
&lsquo;From the mountains over there,&rsquo; pointing to the Mourne
Mountains looming faintly in the mists on the western horizon. The
Irish custom known to my Manx informant is interesting both as throwing
light on the Manx custom, and as being the continuation of a very
ancient rite <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb310" href="#pb310" name=
"pb310">310</a>]</span>mentioned by Cormac. That writer, or somebody in
his name, says that <i>belltaine</i>, May-day, was so called from the
&lsquo;lucky fire,&rsquo; or the &lsquo;two fires,&rsquo; which the
druids of Erin used to make on that day with great incantations; and
cattle, he adds, used to be brought to those fires, or to be driven
between them, as a safeguard against the diseases of the year.
Cormac<a class="noteref" id="xd25e12916src" href="#xd25e12916" name=
"xd25e12916src">13</a> says nothing, it will be noticed, as to one of
the cattle or the sheep being sacrificed for the sake of prosperity to
the rest. However, Scottish<a class="noteref" id="xd25e12919src" href=
"#xd25e12919" name="xd25e12919src">14</a> May-day customs point to a
sacrifice having been once usual, and that possibly of human beings,
and not of sheep as in the Isle of Man. I have elsewhere<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e12937src" href="#xd25e12937" name=
"xd25e12937src">15</a> tried to equate these Celtic May-day practices
with the Thargelia<a class="noteref" id="xd25e12944src" href=
"#xd25e12944" name="xd25e12944src">16</a> of the Athenians of
antiquity. The Thargelia were characterized by peculiar rites, and
among other things then done, two adult persons were led about, as it
were scapegoats, and at the end they were sacrificed and burnt, so that
their ashes might be dispersed. Here we seem to be on the track of a
very ancient Aryan practice, although the Celtic season does not quite
coincide with the Greek one. Several items of importance for comparison
here will be found passed under careful review in a most suggestive
paper by Mr. Lawrence Gomme, &lsquo;On the Method of determining the
Value of Folklore as Ethnological Data,&rsquo; in the Fourth Report of
the Ethnographical Survey Committee<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e12953src" href="#xd25e12953" name="xd25e12953src">17</a>.</p>
<p>It is probably in some ancient May-day custom that <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb311" href="#pb311" name="pb311">311</a>]</span>we
are to look for the key to a remarkable place-name occurring several
times in the island: I allude to that of <i>Cronk yn Irree Laa</i>,
which probably means the Hill of the Rise of Day. This is the name of
one of the mountains in the south of the island, but it is also borne
by one of the knolls near the eastern end of the range of low hills
ending abruptly on the coast between Ramsey and Bride parish, and quite
a small knoll bears the name, near the church of Jurby<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e12966src" href="#xd25e12966" name=
"xd25e12966src">18</a>. I have heard of a fourth instance, which, as I
learn from Mr. Philip Kermode, editor of the <i>Lioar Manninagh</i>, is
on Clay Head, near Laxey. It has been attempted to explain it as
meaning the Hill of the Watch by Day, in reference to the old
institution of Watch and Ward on conspicuous places in the island; but
that explanation is inadmissible as doing violence to the phonetics of
the words in question<a class="noteref" id="xd25e12972src" href=
"#xd25e12972" name="xd25e12972src">19</a>. I am rather inclined to
think that the name everywhere refers to an eminence to which the
surrounding inhabitants resorted for a religious purpose on a
particular day in the year. I should suggest that it was to do homage
to the rising sun on May morning, but this conjecture is offered only
to await a better explanation. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb312"
href="#pb312" name="pb312">312</a>]</span></p>
<p>The next great day in the pagan calendar of the Celts is called in
Manx <i lang="gv">Laa Lhunys</i>, in Irish <i>Lugnassad</i>, the
assembly or fair, which was associated with the name of the god Lug.
This should correspond to Lammas, but, reckoned as it is according to
the Old Style, it falls on the twelfth of August, which used to be a
great day for business fairs in the Isle of Man as in Wales. But for
holiday making the twelfth only suited when it happened to be a Sunday:
when that was not the case, the first Sunday after the twelfth was
fixed upon. It is known, accordingly, as the first Sunday of Harvest,
and it used to be celebrated by crowds of people visiting the tops of
the mountains. The kind of interference to which I have alluded with
regard to an ancient holiday, is one of the regular results of the
transition from Roman Catholicism to a Protestant system with only one
fixed holiday, namely, Sunday. The same shifting has partly happened in
Wales, where Lammas is <i>Gwyl Awst</i>, or the festival of Augustus,
since the birthday of Augustus, auspiciously for him and the celebrity
of his day, fell in with the great day of the god Lug in the Celtic
world. Now the day for going up the Fan Fach mountain in
Carmarthenshire was Lammas, but under a Protestant Church it became the
first Sunday in August; and even modified in that way it could not long
survive under a vigorous sabbatarian <i>r&eacute;gime</i> either in
Wales or Man. As to the latter in particular, I have heard it related
by persons who were present, how the crowds on the top of South Barrule
on the first Sunday of Harvest were denounced as pagans by a preacher
called William Gick, some seventy years ago; and how another man called
Paric Beg, or Little Patrick, preaching to the crowds on Snaefell in
milder terms, used to wind up the service with a collection, which
appears to have proved a speedier method <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb313" href="#pb313" name="pb313">313</a>]</span>of reducing the
dimensions of these meetings on the mountain tops. Be that as it may,
they seem to have dwindled since then to comparative
insignificance.</p>
<p>If you ask the reason for this custom now, for it is not yet quite
extinct, you are told, first, that it is merely to gather ling berries;
but now and then a quasi-religious reason is given, namely, that it is
the day on which Jephthah&rsquo;s daughter went forth to bewail her
virginity &lsquo;upon the mountains&rsquo;: somehow some Manx people
make believe that they are doing likewise. That is not all, for people
who have never themselves thought of going up the mountains on the
first Sunday of harvest or any other, will be found devoutly reading at
home about Jephthah&rsquo;s daughter on that day. I was told this first
in the south by a clergyman&rsquo;s wife, who, finding a woman in the
parish reading the chapter in question on that day, asked the reason
for her fixing on that particular portion of the Bible. She then had
the Manx view of the matter fully explained to her, and she has since
found more information about it, and so have I. It is needless for me
to say that I do not quite understand how Jephthah&rsquo;s daughter
came to be introduced: perhaps it is vain to look for any deeper reason
than that the mention, of the mountains may have served as a sort of
catch-word, and that as the Manx people began to cease from visiting
the tops of the mountains annually, it struck the women as the next
best thing for them to read at home of one who did &lsquo;go up and
down upon the mountains&rsquo;: they are great readers of the Bible
generally. In any case we have here a very curious instance of a
practice, originally pagan, modifying itself profoundly to secure a new
lease of life.</p>
<p>Between May-day and November eve, there was a day of considerable
importance in the island; but the fixing on it was probably due to
influence other than <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb314" href="#pb314"
name="pb314">314</a>]</span>Celtic: I mean Midsummer Eve, or St.
John&rsquo;s. However, some practices connected with it would seem to
have been of Celtic origin, such as &lsquo;the bearing of rushes to
certain places called Warrefield and Mame on Midsummer Even.&rsquo;
Warrefield was made in Manx into <i>Barrule</i>, but <i>Mame</i>,
&lsquo;the <i>jugum</i>, or ridge,&rsquo; has not been identified. The
Barrule here in question was South Barrule, and it is to the top of
that mountain the green rushes were carried, according to Manx
tradition, as the only rent or tax which the inhabitants paid, namely,
to Manann&aacute;n mac Lir (called in Welsh Manawy&#273;an ab
&#7930;yr), whom the same tradition treats as father and founder, as
king and chief wizard of the Isle of Man, the same Manann&aacute;n who
is quaintly referred to in the illiterate passage at the head of this
chapter<a class="noteref" id="xd25e13023src" href="#xd25e13023" name=
"xd25e13023src">20</a>. As already stated, the payment of the annual
rent of rushes is associated with Midsummer Eve; but it did not prevent
the top of South Barrule from being visited likewise later in the year.
Perhaps it may also be worth while mentioning, with regard to most of
the mountains climbed on the first Sunday of Harvest, that they seem to
have near the summit of each a well of some celebrity, which appears to
be the goal of the visitors&rsquo; peregrinations. This is the case
with South Barrule, the spring near the top of which cannot, it is
said, be found when sought a second time; also with Snaefell and with
Maughold Head, which boasts one of the most famous springs in the
island. When I visited it last summer in company with Mr. Kermode, we
found it to contain a considerable number of pins, some of which were
bent, and many buttons. Some of the pins were not of a kind usually
carried by men, and most of the buttons decidedly belonged to the dress
of the other sex. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb315" href="#pb315"
name="pb315">315</a>]</span>Several people who had resorted many years
ago to St. Maughold&rsquo;s Well, told me that the water is good for
sore eyes, and that after using it on the spot, or filling a bottle
with it to take home, one was wont to drop a pin or bead or button into
the well. But it had its full virtue only when visited the first Sunday
of Harvest, and that only during the hour when the books were open at
church, which, shifted back to Roman Catholic times, means doubtless
the hour when the priest was engaged in saying Mass. Compare the
passage in the <i>Mabinogi</i> of Math, where it is said that the spear
required for the slaying of &#7930;ew &#7930;awgyffes had to be a whole
year in the making: the work was to be pursued only so long as one was
engaged at the sacrifice on Sunday (<i lang="cy">ar yr aberth du&#7933;
sul</i>): see the Oxford <i>Mabinogion</i>, p. 76. To return to Man,
the restriction, as might be expected, is not peculiar to St.
Maughold&rsquo;s Well: I have heard of it in connexion with other
wells, such as Chibbyr Lansh in Lezayre parish, and with a well on
Slieau Maggyl, in which some Kirk Michael people have a great belief.
But even sea water was believed to have considerable virtues if you
washed in it while the books were open at church, as I was told by a
woman who had many years ago repeatedly taken her own sister to divers
wells and to the sea during the service on Sunday, in order to have her
eyes cured of a chronic weakness.</p>
<p>The remaining great day in the Celtic year is called <i>Sauin</i> or
<i>Laa Houney</i>: in Irish, <i>Samhain</i>, genitive <i>Samhna</i>.
The Manx call it in English <i>Hollantide</i>, a word derived from the
English <i>All hallowen tide</i>, &lsquo;the Season of All
Saints<a class="noteref" id="xd25e13068src" href="#xd25e13068" name=
"xd25e13068src">21</a>.&rsquo; This day is also reckoned in Man
according to the Old Style, so that it is our twelfth of November. That
is the day when <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb316" href="#pb316"
name="pb316">316</a>]</span>the tenure of land terminates, and when
servant men go to their places. In other words, it is the beginning of
a new year; and Kelly, in his <i>Manx-English Dictionary</i>, has,
under the word <i>blein</i>, &lsquo;year,&rsquo; the following
note:&mdash;&lsquo;Vallancey says the Celts began their year with
January; yet in the Isle of Man the first of November is called New
Year&rsquo;s day by the Mummers, who, on the eve, begin their petition
in these words: <i>To-night is New Year&rsquo;s night,
Hog-unnaa</i><a class="noteref" id="xd25e13085src" href="#xd25e13085"
name="xd25e13085src">22</a>, &amp;c.&rsquo; It is a pity that Kelly,
whilst he was on this subject, did not give the rhyme in Manx, and all
the more so, as the mummers of the present day, if he is right, must
have changed their words into <i>Noght oie Houney</i>, that is to say,
To-night is Sauin Night or Halloween. So I had despaired of finding
anybody who could corroborate Kelly in his statement, when I happened
last summer to find a man at Kirk Michael who was quite familiar with
this way of treating the year. I asked him if he could explain
Kelly&rsquo;s absurd statement&mdash;I put my question designedly in
that form. He said he could, but that there was nothing absurd in it.
He then told me how he had heard some old people talk of it: he is
himself now about sixty-seven. He had been a farm servant from the age
of sixteen till he was twenty-six to the same man, near Regaby, in the
parish of Andreas, and he remembers his master and a near neighbour of
his discussing the term New Year&rsquo;s Day as applied to the first of
November, and explaining to the younger men that it had always been so
in old times. In fact, it seemed to him natural enough, as all
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb317" href="#pb317" name=
"pb317">317</a>]</span>tenure of land ends at that time, and as all
servant men begin their service then. I cross-examined him, without
succeeding in any way in shaking his evidence. I should have been glad
a few years ago to have come across this piece of information, or even
Kelly&rsquo;s note, when I was discussing the Celtic year and trying to
prove<a class="noteref" id="xd25e13105src" href="#xd25e13105" name=
"xd25e13105src">23</a> that it began at the beginning of winter, with
May-day as the beginning of its second half.</p>
<p>One of the characteristics of the beginning of the Celtic year with
the commencement of winter was the belief that indications can be
obtained on the eve of that day regarding the events of the year; but
with the calendar year gaining ground it would be natural to expect
that the Calends of January would have some of the associations of the
Calends of Winter transferred to them, and vice versa. In fact, this
can, as it were, be watched now going on in the Isle of Man. First, I
may mention that the Manx mummers used to go about singing, in Manx, a
sort of Hogmanay song<a class="noteref" id="xd25e13113src" href=
"#xd25e13113" name="xd25e13113src">24</a>, reminding one of that usual
in Yorkshire and other parts of Great Britain, and now known to be of
Romance origin<a class="noteref" id="xd25e13150src" href="#xd25e13150"
name="xd25e13150src">25</a>. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb318" href=
"#pb318" name="pb318">318</a>]</span>The time for it in this country
was New Year&rsquo;s Eve, according to the ordinary calendar, but in
the Isle of Man it has always been Hollantide Eve, according to the Old
Style, and this is the night when boys now go about continuing the
custom of the old mummers. There is no hesitation in this case between
Hollantide Eve and New Year&rsquo;s Eve. But with the prognostications
for the year it is different, and the following practices have been
usual. I may, however, premise that as a rule I have abstained from
inquiring too closely whether they still go on, but here and there I
have had the information volunteered that they do.</p>
<p>1. I may mention first a salt prognostication, which was described
to me by a farmer in the north, whose wife practises it once a year
regularly. She carefully fills a thimble with salt in the evening and
upsets it in a neat little heap on a plate: she does that for every
member of the family, and every guest, too, if there happen to be any.
The plate is then left undisturbed till the morning, when she examines
the heaps of salt to see if any of them have fallen; for whoever is
found represented by a fallen heap will die during the year. She does
not herself, I am assured, believe in it, but she likes to continue a
custom which she has learned from her mother.</p>
<p>2. Next may be mentioned the ashes being carefully swept to the open
hearth, and nicely flattened down by the women just before going to
bed. In the morning they look for footmarks on the hearth, and if they
find such footmarks directed towards the door, it means, in the course
of the year, a death in the family, and if the reverse, they expect an
addition to it by marriage<a class="noteref" id="xd25e13179src" href=
"#xd25e13179" name="xd25e13179src">26</a>. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb319" href="#pb319" name="pb319">319</a>]</span></p>
<p>3. Then there is an elaborate process of eavesdropping recommended
to young women curious to know their future husbands&rsquo; names: a
girl would go with her mouth full of water and her hands full of salt
to the door of the nearest neighbour&rsquo;s house, or rather to that
of the nearest neighbour but one&mdash;I have been carefully corrected
more than once on that point. There she would listen, and the first
name she caught would prove to be that of her future husband. Once a
girl did so, as I was told by a blind fisherman in the south, and heard
two brothers quarrelling inside the house at whose door she was
listening. Presently the young men&rsquo;s mother exclaimed that the
devil would not let Tom leave John alone. At the mention of that triad
the girl burst into the house, laughing and spilling the mouthful of
water most incontinently. The end of it was that before the year was
out she married Tom, the second person mentioned: the first either did
not count or proved an unassailable bachelor.</p>
<p>4. There is also a ritual for enabling a girl to obtain other
information respecting her future husband: vessels placed about the
room have various things put into them, such as clean water, earth,
meal, a piece of a net, or any other article thought appropriate. The
candidate for matrimony, with her eyes bandaged, feels her way about
the house until she puts her hand in one of the aforesaid vessels. If

name="xd25e13192src">27</a>; if it is the earth, he will be a farmer;

<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb320" href="#pb320" name=

consideration.</p>
<p>5. Lastly, recourse may be had to a ritual of the same nature as
that observed by the druid of ancient Erin, when, burdened with a heavy
meal of the flesh of a red pig, he laid him down for the night in order
to await a prophetic dream as to the manner of man the nobles of Erin
assembled at Tara were to elect to be their king. The incident is given
in the story of C&uacute;chulainn&rsquo;s Sick-bed; and the reader,
doubtless, knows the passage about Brian and the <i>taghairm</i> in the
fourth Canto of Scott&rsquo;s <i>Lady of the Lake</i>. But the Manx
girl has only to eat a salt herring, bones and all, without drinking or
uttering a word, and to retire backwards to bed. When she sleeps and
dreams, she will behold her future husband approaching to give her
drink.</p>
<p>Probably none of the practices which I have enumerated, or similar
ones mentioned to me, are in any sense peculiar to the Isle of Man; but
what interests me in them is the divided opinion as to the proper night
for them in the year. I am sorry to say that I have very little
information as to the blindman&rsquo;s-buff ritual (No. 4); what
information I have, to wit, the evidence of two persons in the south,
fixes it on Hollantide Eve. But as to the others (Nos. 1, 2, 3, 5),
they are observed by some on that night, and by others on New
Year&rsquo;s Eve, sometimes according to the Old Style<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e13219src" href="#xd25e13219" name=
"xd25e13219src">28</a> and sometimes the New. Further, those who are
wont to practise the salt heap ritual, for instance, on Hollantide Eve,
would be very indignant to hear that anybody should think New
Year&rsquo;s Eve the proper night, and vice versa. So by bringing women
bred and born in different <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb321" href=
"#pb321" name="pb321">321</a>]</span>parishes to compare notes on this
point, I have witnessed arguing hardly less earnest than that which
characterized the ancient controversy between British and Italian
ecclesiastics as to the proper time for keeping Easter. I have not been
able to map the island according to the practices prevalent at
Hollantide and the beginning of January, but local folklorists could
probably do it without much difficulty. My impression, however, is that
January is gradually acquiring the upper hand. In Wales this must have
been decidedly helped by the influence of Roman rule and Roman ideas;
but even there the adjuncts of the Winter Calends have never been
wholly transferred to the Calends of January. Witness, for instance,
the women who used to congregate in the parish church to discover who
of the parishioners would die during the year<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e13233src" href="#xd25e13233" name="xd25e13233src">29</a>. That
custom, in the neighbourhoods reported to have practised it, continued
to attach itself to the last, so far as I know, to the beginning of
November. In the Isle of Man the fact of the ancient Celtic year having
so firmly held its own, seems to point to the probability that the year
of the Pagan Norsemen pretty nearly coincided with that of the
Celts<a class="noteref" id="xd25e13242src" href="#xd25e13242" name=
"xd25e13242src">30</a>. For there are reasons to think, as I have
endeavoured elsewhere to show, that the Norse Yule was originally at
the end of summer or the commencement of winter, in other words, the
days afterwards known as the Feast of the Winter Nights. This was the
favourite date in Iceland for listening to soothsayers prophesying with
regard to the winter then beginning. The late Dr. Vigfusson had much to
say <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb322" href="#pb322" name=
"pb322">322</a>]</span>on this subject, and how the local sibyl,
resuming her elevated seat at the opening of each successive winter,
gave the author of the <i>Volosp&aacute;</i> his plan of that
remarkable poem, which has been described by the same authority as the
highest spiritual effort of the heathen muse of the North. <span class=

Manx word for the rowan tree, incorrectly called a mountain ash, is
<i>cuirn</i>, which is in Mod. Irish <i>caorthann</i>, genitive
<i>caorthainn</i>, Scotch Gaelic <i>caorunn</i>; but in Welsh books it
is <i>cer&#273;in</i>, singular <i>cer&#273;inen</i>, and in the spoken
language mostly <i>cerdin</i>, <i>cerding</i>, singular
<i>cerdinen</i>, <i>cerdingen</i>. This variation seems to indicate
that these words have possibly been borrowed by the Welsh from a
Goidelic source; but the berry is known in Wales by the native name of
<i>criafol</i>, from which the wood is frequently called, especially in
North Wales, <i>coed criafol</i>, singular <i>coeden griafol</i> or
<i>pren criafol</i>. The sacredness of the rowan is the key to the
proper names Mac-C&aacute;irthinn and Der-Ch&aacute;irthinn, with which
the student of Irish hagiology is familiar. They mean the Son and the
Daughter of the Rowan respectively, and the former occurs as <i>Maqui
Cairatini</i> on an Ogam inscribed stone recently discovered in Meath,

<i lang="gv">Cronk yn Irree Laa</i>, despite the gender, is the name as
pronounced by all Manxmen who have not been misled by antiquarians. To
convey the other meaning, referring to the day watch, the name would
have to be <i lang="gv">Cronk ny Harrey Laa</i>; in fact, a part of the
Howe in the south of the island is called <i lang="gv">Cronk ny
Harrey</i>, &lsquo;the Hill of the Watch.&rsquo; Mr. Moore tells me
that the Jurby <i>cronk</i> was one of the eminences for &lsquo;Watch
and Ward&rsquo;; but he is now of opinion that the high mountain of
Cronk yn Irree Laa in the south was not. As to the duty of the
inhabitants to keep &lsquo;Watch and Ward&rsquo; over the island, see
the passage concerning it extracted from the Manx Statutes (vol. i. p.

<p class="first">The last chapter is hardly such as to call for a
recapitulation of its principal contents, and I venture to submit
instead of any such repetition an abstract of some very pertinent notes
on it by Miss M. G. W. Peacock, who compares with the folklore of the
Isle of Man the old beliefs which survive in Lincolnshire among the
descendants of Norse ancestors<a class="noteref" id="xd25e13276src"
href="#xd25e13276" name="xd25e13276src">1</a>. She was attracted by the
striking affinity which she noticed between them, and she is doubtless
right in regarding that affinity as due in no small degree to the
Scandinavian element present in the population alike of Man and the
East of England. She is, however, not lavish of theory, but gives us
interesting items of information from an intimate acquaintance with the
folklore of the district of which she undertakes to speak, somewhat in
the following order:&mdash;</p>
<p>1. Whether the water-bull still inhabits the streams of Lincolnshire
she regards as doubtful, but the deep pools formed, she says, by the
action of the down-flowing water at the bends of the country becks are
still known as bull-holes. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb324" href=
"#pb324" name="pb324">324</a>]</span></p>
<p>2. As to the <i>glashtyn</i>, or water-horse, she remarks that the
tatter-foal, tatter-colt, or shag-foal, as he is variously called, is
still to be heard of, although his visits take place less often than
before the fens and carrs were drained and the open fields and commons
enclosed. She describes the tatter-foal as a goblin of the shape and
appearance of a small horse or yearling foal in his rough, unkempt
coat. He beguiles lonely travellers with his numberless tricks, one of
which is to lure them to a stream, swamp, or water-hole. When he has
succeeded he vanishes with a long outburst of mockery, half neigh, half
human laughter.</p>
<p>3. The fenodyree, one is told, has in Lincolnshire a cousin, but he
is diminutive; and, like the Yorkshire Hob or Robin Round-Cap, and the
Danish Niss, he is used to befriend the house in which he dwells. The
story of his driving the farmer&rsquo;s sheep home is the same
practically as in the Isle of Man, even to the point of bringing in
with them <i>the little grey sheep</i>, as he called the fine hare that
had given him more trouble than all the rest of the flock: see pp.
286&ndash;7 above.</p>
<p>4. The story of this manikin&rsquo;s clothing differs considerably
from that of the fenodyree. The farmer gives him in gratitude for his
services a linen shirt every New Year&rsquo;s Eve; and this went on for
years, until at last the farmer thought a hemp shirt was good enough to
give him. When the clock struck twelve at midnight the manikin raised
an angry wail, saying:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Harden, harden, harden hemp!</p>
<p class="line">I will neither grind nor stamp!</p>
<p class="line">Had you given me linen gear,</p>
<p class="line">I would have served you many a year!</p>
</div>
<p class="first">He was no more seen or heard: he vanished for ever.
The Cornish counterpart of this brownie reasons in the opposite way;
for when, in gratitude for his help in <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb325" href="#pb325" name="pb325">325</a>]</span>threshing, a new suit
of clothes is given him, he hurries away, crying<a class="noteref" id=

<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Pisky new coat, and pisky new hood,</p>
<p class="line">Pisky now will do no more good.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Here, also, one should compare William
Nicholson&rsquo;s account of the brownie of Blednoch<a class="noteref"

</div>
</div>
<p class="first">The only account which I have been able to find of a
Welsh counterpart will be found in <i lang="cy">Bwca&rsquo;r Trwyn</i>,
in chapter x: he differs in some important respects from the fenodyree
and the brownie.</p>
<p>5. A twig of the rowan tree, or <i>wicken</i>, as it is called, was
effective against all evil things, including witches. It is useful in
many ways to guard the welfare of the household, and to preserve both
the live stock and the crops, while placed on the churn it prevents any
malign influence from retarding the coming of the butter. I may remark
that Celts and Teutons seem to have been generally pretty well agreed
as to the virtues of the rowan tree. Bits of iron also are lucky
against witches. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb326" href="#pb326"
name="pb326">326</a>]</span></p>
<p>6. Fairies are rare, but witches and wizards abound, and some of
them have been supposed to change themselves into dogs to worry sheep
and cattle, or into toads to poison the swine&rsquo;s troughs. But they
do not seem to change themselves into hares, as in Man and other Celtic
lands.</p>
<p>7. Witchcraft, says Miss Peacock, is often hereditary, passing most
frequently from mother to daughter; but when a witch has no daughter
her power may appear in a son, and then revert to the female line. This
appears far more natural than the Manx belief in its passing from
father to daughter and from daughter to son. But another kind of
succession is mentioned in the Welsh Triads, i. 32, ii. 20, iii. 90,
which speak of Math ab Mathonwy teaching his magic to Gwydion, who as
his sister&rsquo;s son was to succeed him in his kingdom; and of a
certain Rhu&#273;lwm Dwarf teaching his magic to Co&#7931;, son of
Co&#7931;frewi, his nephew. Both instances seem to point to a state of
society which did not reckon paternity but only birth.</p>
<p>8. Only three years previous to Miss Peacock&rsquo;s writing an old
man died, she says, who had seen blood drawn from a witch because she
had, as was supposed, laid a spell on a team of horses: as soon as she
was struck so as to bleed the horses and their load were free to go on
their way again. Possibly no equally late instance could be specified
in the Isle of Man: see p. 296 above.</p>
<p>9. Traces of animal sacrifice may still be found in Lincolnshire,
for the heart of a small beast, or of a bird, is necessary, Miss
Peacock says, for the efficient performance of several counter-charms,
especially in torturing a witch by the reversal of her spells, and
warding off evil from houses or other buildings. Apparently Miss
Peacock has not heard of so considerable a victim <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb327" href="#pb327" name="pb327">327</a>]</span>as a
sheep or a calf being sacrificed, as in the Isle of Man, but the
objects of the sacrifices may be said to be the same.</p>
<p>10. Several pin and rag wells are said to exist in Lincolnshire,
their waters being supposed to possess healing virtues, especially as
regards eye ailments.</p>
<p>11. Love-spells and prognostications are mentioned, some of them as
belonging to Allhallows, as they do partly in the Isle of Man: she
mentions the making of dumb cake, and the eating of the salt herring,
followed by dreams of the future husband bringing the thirsting lass
drink in a jug, the quality of which indicates the bearer&rsquo;s
position in life. But other Lincolnshire practices of the kind seem to
oscillate between Allhallows and St. Mark&rsquo;s Eve, while
gravitating decidedly towards the latter date. Here it is preferable to
give Miss Peacock&rsquo;s own words:&mdash;&lsquo;Professor Rhys&rsquo;
mention of the footmark in the ashes reminds me of a love-spell current
in the Wapentake of Manley in North Lincolnshire. Properly speaking, it
should be put in practice on St. Mark&rsquo;s E&rsquo;en, that eerie
spring-tide festival when those who are skilled may watch the church
porch and learn who will die in the ensuing twelvemonth; but there is
little doubt that the charm is also used at Hallow E&rsquo;en, and at
other suitable seasons of the year. The spell consists in riddling
ashes on the hearthstone, or beans on the floor of the barn, with
proper ceremonies and at the proper time, with the result that the girl
who works her incantation correctly finds the footprint of the man she
is to marry clearly marked on the sifted mass the following morning. It
is to be supposed that the spirit of the lover is responsible for the
mark, as, according to another folk-belief, any girl who watches her
supper on St. Mark&rsquo;s E&rsquo;en will see the spirit of the man
she will wed come into the room at midnight to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb328" href="#pb328" name=
"pb328">328</a>]</span>partake of the food provided. The room must be
one with the door and windows in different walls, and both must be
open. The spirit comes in by the door (and goes out by the window?).
Each girl who undertakes to keep watch must have a separate supper and
a separate candle, and all talking is to end before the clock goes
twelve, for there must not be any speaking before the spirits. From
these superstitions, and from the generally received idea that the
spirits of all the parishioners are to be observed entering the church
on St. Mark&rsquo;s E&rsquo;en, it may be inferred that the Manx
footprint is made by the wraith of the person doomed to death.&rsquo;
Compare pp. 318&ndash;9 above.</p>
<p>What Miss Peacock alludes to as watching the church porch was
formerly well known in Wales<a class="noteref" id="xd25e13386src" href=
"#xd25e13386" name="xd25e13386src">4</a>, and may be illustrated from a
district so far east as the Golden Valley, in Herefordshire, by the
following story told me in 1892 by Mrs. Powell of Dorstone, on the
strength of what she had learnt from her mother-in-law, the late Mrs.
Powell, who was a native of that parish:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;On Allhallows Eve at midnight, those who are bold enough to
look through the church windows will see the building lighted with an
unearthly light, and the pulpit occupied by his Satanic majesty clothed
in a monk&rsquo;s habit. Dreadful anathemas are the burden of his
preaching, and the names of those who in the coming year are to render
up their souls may be heard by those who have courage to listen. A
notorious evil liver, Jack of France, once by chance passed the church
at this awful moment: looking in he saw the lights and heard the voice,
and his own name in the horrid list; and, according to some versions of
the story, he went home <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb329" href=
"#pb329" name="pb329">329</a>]</span>to die of fright. Others say that
he repented and died in good repute, and so cheated the evil one of his
prey.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I have no list of places in Wales and its marches which have this
sort of superstition associated with them, but it is my impression that
they are mostly referred to Allhallows, as at Dorstone, and that where
that is not the case they have been shifted to the beginning of the
year as at present reckoned; for in Celtic lands, at least, they seem
to have belonged to what was reckoned the beginning of the year. The
old Celtic year undoubtedly began at Allhallows, and the day next in
importance after the Calends of Winter (in Welsh
<i>Calang&aacute;eaf</i>) was, among the Celts, the beginning of the
summer half of the year, or the Calends of May (in Welsh
<i>Cal&aacute;nmai</i>), which St. Mark&rsquo;s Eve approaches too
nearly for us to regard it as accidental. With this modified agreement
between the Lincolnshire date and the Celtic one contrast the
irreconcilable English date of St. John&rsquo;s Eve; and see
Tylor&rsquo;s <i>Primitive Culture</i>, i. 440, where one reads as
follows of &lsquo;the well-known superstition,&rsquo; &lsquo;that
fasting watchers on St. John&rsquo;s Eve may see the apparitions of
those doomed to die during the year come with the clergyman to the
church door and knock; these apparitions are spirits who come forth
from their bodies, for the minister has been noticed to be much
troubled in his sleep while his phantom was thus engaged, and when one
of a party of watchers fell into a sound sleep and could not be roused,
the others saw his apparition knock at the church door.&rsquo; With an
unerring instinct for the intelligent colligation of facts, Miss
Peacock finds the nearest approach to the yearly review of the
moritures, if I may briefly so call them, in the wraith&rsquo;s
footprint in the ashes. Perhaps a more systematic examination of Manx
folklore may result in the discovery of a more exact parallel.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb330" href="#pb330" name=

<p>For want of knowing where else to put it, I may mention here in
reference to the dead, a passage which has been copied for me by my
friend Mr. Gwenogvryn Evans, from Manuscript 163 in the Peniarth
Collection. I understand it to be of the earlier part of the sixteenth
century, and p. 10 has the following passage:&mdash;</p>
<p lang="cy"><i>Yn yr ynys honn</i> [<i>Manaw</i>] <i>y kair gweled liw
dy&#273; bobyl a vvessynt veirw / Rrai gwedi tori penav / erai&#7931;
gwedi torri i haelode / Ac os dieithred a &#273;issyfynt i gweled hwynt
/ Sengi ar draed gwyr or tir ac ve&#7931;y hwynt a gaent weled yr hyn a
welssynt hwyntav.</i></p>
<p>&lsquo;In this island [Man] one beholds in the light of day people
who have died, some with their heads cut off and others with their
limbs cut off. And if strangers desire to see them, they have to stand
on the feet of the natives of the land, and in that way they would see
what the latter had seen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A similar instance of the virtue of standing on the feet of another
person has been mentioned in reference to the farmer of Deunant, at p.
230 above; the foot, however, on which he had to stand in order to get
a glimpse of the fairy world, was a fairy&rsquo;s own foot.</p>
<p>Lastly, the passage in the Peniarth Manuscript has something more to
say of the Isle of Man, as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p lang="cy"><i>Mawr oe&#273; arfer o swynion a chyvare&#273;ion gynt
yn yr ynys honn / Kanys gwrage&#273; a vy&#273;ynt yno yn gwnevthvr
gwynt i longwyr gwedir gav mewn tri chwlm o edav aphan vai eissie gwynt
arnynt dattod kwlm or edav anaynt.</i></p>
<p>&lsquo;Great was the practice formerly of spells and sorceries in
this island; for there used to be there women making wind for sailors,
which wind they confined within three knots made on a thread. And when
they had need of wind they would undo a knot of the thread.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This was written in the sixteenth century, and based probably on
Higden&rsquo;s <i>Polychronicon</i>, book I, chap. xliv<span class=
"corr" id="xd25e13438" title="Not in source">.</span> <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb331" href="#pb331" name="pb331">331</a>]</span>(=
I. 42&ndash;3), but the same practice of wind making goes on to this
day, one of the principal practitioners being the woman to whom
reference was made at p. 299. She is said to tie the breezes in so many
knots which she makes on the purchasing sailor&rsquo;s
pocket-handkerchief. This reminds one of the sibyl of Warinsey, or the
Island of Guernsey, who is represented by an ancient Norse poet as
&lsquo;fashioning false prophecies.&rsquo; See Vigfusson and
Powell&rsquo;s <i>Corpus Poeticum Boreale</i>, i. 136; also
Mela&rsquo;s first-century account of the virgins of the island of
Sena, which runs to the following effect:&mdash;&lsquo;Sena, in the
Britannic Sea, opposite the coast of the Osismi, is famous for its
oracle of a Gaulish god, whose priestesses, living in the holiness of
perpetual virginity, are said to be nine in number. They call them
Gallizen&aelig;, and they believe them to be endowed with extraordinary
gifts to rouse the sea and the wind by their incantations, to turn
themselves into whatsoever animal form they may choose, to cure
diseases which among others are incurable, to know what is to come and
to foretell it. They are, however, devoted to the service of voyagers
only who have set out on no other errand than to consult them<a class=

name="xd25e13469src">6</a> inhabitants of the small islands on the
coasts of Gaul and Britain had wellnigh a monopoly of the traffic in
wind<a class="noteref" id="xd25e13484src" href="#xd25e13484" name=

"#pb332" name="pb332">332</a>]</span></p>
<p>In the last chapter I made allusion to several wells of greater or
less celebrity in the Isle of Man; but I find that I have a few remarks
to add. Mr. Arthur Moore, in his book on <i>Manx Surnames and
Place-Names</i>, p. 200, mentions a Chibber Unjin, which means the Well
of the Ash-tree, and he states that there grew near it &lsquo;formerly
a sacred ash-tree, where votive offerings were hung.&rsquo; The
ash-tree calls to his mind Scandinavian legends respecting the ash, but
in any case one may suppose the ash was not the usual tree to expect by
a well in the Isle of Man, otherwise this one would scarcely have been
distinguished as the Ash-tree Well. The tree to expect by a sacred well
is doubtless some kind of thorn, as in the case of Chibber Undin in the
parish of Malew. The name means Foundation Well, so called in reference
probably to the foundations of an ancient cell, or <i>keeill</i> as it
is called in Manx, which lie close by, and are found to measure
twenty-one feet long by twelve feet broad. The following is Mr.
Moore&rsquo;s account of the well in his book already cited, p.
181:&mdash;&lsquo;The water of this well is supposed to have curative
properties. The patients who came to it, took a mouthful of water,
retaining it in their mouths till they had twice walked round the well.
They then took a piece of cloth from a garment which they had worn,
wetted it with the water from the well, and hung it on the hawthorn
tree which grew there. When the cloth had rotted away, the cure was
supposed to be effected.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I visited the spot a few years ago in the company of the Rev. E. B.
Savage of St. Thomas&rsquo; Parsonage, Douglas, and we found the well
nearly dried up in consequence of the drainage of the field around it;
but the remains of the old cell were there, and the thorn bush had
strips of cloth or calico tied to its branches. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb333" href="#pb333" name="pb333">333</a>]</span>We
cut off one, which is now in the Pitt-Rivers Museum at Oxford. The
account Mr. Savage had of the ritual observed at the well differed a
little from that given by Mr. Moore, especially in the fact that it
made the patient who had been walking round the well with water from
the well in his mouth, empty that water finally into a rag from his
clothing: the rag was then tied to a branch of the thorn. It does not
appear that the kind of tree mattered much; nay, a tree is not, it
seems to me, essential. At any rate, St. Maughold&rsquo;s Well has no
tree growing near it now; but it is right to say, that when Mr. Kermode
and I visited it, we could find no rags left near the spot, nor indeed
could we expect to find any, as there was nothing to which they might
be tied on that windy headland. The absence of the tree does not,
however, prove that the same sort of ritual was not formerly observed
at St. Maughold&rsquo;s Well as at Chibber Undin; and here I must
mention another well which I have visited in the island more than once.
It is on the side of Bradda Hill, a little above the village of Bradda,
and in the direction of Fleshwick: I was attracted to it by the fact
that it had, as I had been told by Mr. Savage, formerly an old cell or
<i>keeill</i> near it, and the name of the saint to which it belonged
may probably be gathered from the name of the well, which, in the Manx
of the south of the island, is Chibbyrt Valtane, pronounced
approximately Ch&#365;&#769;vurt Volt&aacute;ne or Ol&#273;&aacute;ne.
The personal name would be written in modern Manx in its radical form
as Boltane, and if it occurred in the genitive in Ogam inscriptions I
should expect to find it written <i>Boltagni</i> or
<i>Baltagni</i><a class="noteref" id="xd25e13508src" href="#xd25e13508"
name="xd25e13508src">8</a>. It is, however, unknown to me, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb334" href="#pb334" name=
"pb334">334</a>]</span>though to be placed possibly by the side of the
name of the saint after whom the parish of Santon is called in the
south-east of the island. This is pronounced in Manx
approximately<a class="noteref" id="xd25e13557src" href="#xd25e13557"
name="xd25e13557src">9</a> Santane or San&#273;ane, and would have
yielded an early inscriptional nominative <span class=
"sc">SANCTANVS</span>, which, in fact, occurs on an old stone near
&#7930;andudno on the Welsh coast: see some notes of mine in point in
the <i lang="la">Arch&aelig;ologia Cambrensis</i>, 1897, pp.
140&ndash;2. To return to the well, it would seem to have been
associated with an old cell, but it has no tree growing by. Mr. Savage
and I were told, nevertheless, that a boy who had searched the well a
short time previously had got some coins out of it, quite recent ones,
consisting of halfpennies or pennies, so far as I remember. On my
observing to one of the neighbours that I saw no rags there, I was
assured that there had been some; and, on my further saying that I saw
no tree there to which they could be tied, I was told that they used to
be attached to the brambles, which grew there in great abundance. Thus
it appears that, in the Isle of Man at any rate, a tree to bear the
rags was not an essential adjunct of a holy well.</p>
<p>Before leaving these well superstitions the reader may wish to know
how they were understood in Ireland <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb335" href="#pb335" name="pb335">335</a>]</span>not long ago: so I
venture to quote a passage from a letter by the late Mr. W. C. Borlase
on Rag Offerings and Primitive <span class="corr" id="xd25e13579"
title="Source: Pilgimages">Pilgrimages</span> in Ireland, as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Among the MSS. of the late Mr. Windele, of Cork, &hellip; I
find a passage which cannot fail to interest students of folk-lore. It
relates to the custom of affixing shreds of rag to the hawthorn tree,
which almost invariably stands by the brink of the typical Irish
&ldquo;holy well,&rdquo; and it gives us the meaning of the custom as
understood, some half-century since, by the inhabitants of certain
localities in the province of Munster. The idea is, says the writer,
that the putting up these rags is a putting away of the evils impending
or incurred by sin, an act accompanied by the following ritual words:
<i>Air impide an Tiarna mo chuid teinis do fhagaint air an ait so</i>;
i. e. By the intercession of the Lord I leave my portion of illness on
this place. These words, he adds, should be uttered by whoever performs
the round, and they are, no doubt, of extreme antiquity. Mr. Windele
doubtless took down the words as he heard them locally pronounced,
though, to be correct, for <i>Tiarna</i> should be read <i>Tigerna</i>;
for <i>teinis</i>, <i>tinneas</i>; and for <i>fhagaint</i>,
<i>fhagaim</i><a class="noteref" id="xd25e13605src" href="#xd25e13605"
name="xd25e13605src">10</a>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>From the less known saints Boltane and Santane I wish to pass to the
mention of a more famous one, namely, St. Catherine, and this because
of a fair called after her, and held on the sixth day of December at
the village of Colby in the south of the island. When I heard of this
fair in 1888, it was in temporary abeyance on account of a lawsuit
respecting the plot of ground on which the fair is wont to be held; but
I was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb336" href="#pb336" name=
"pb336">336</a>]</span>told that it usually begins with a procession,
in which a live hen is carried about: this is called St.
Catherine&rsquo;s hen. The next day the hen is carried about dead and
plucked, and a rhyme pronounced at a certain point in the proceedings
contemplates the burial of the hen, but whether that ever takes place I
know not. It runs thus:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div lang="gv" class="lg">
<p class="line"><i>Kiark Catrina marroo:</i></p>
<p class="line"><i>Gows yn kione as goyms ny cassyn,</i></p>
<p class="line"><i>As ver mayd ee fo&rsquo;n thalloo.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Catherine&rsquo;s hen is dead:</p>
<p class="line">The head take thou and I the feet,</p>
<p class="line">We shall put her under the ground.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">A man who is found to be not wholly sober after the
fair is locally said to have plucked a feather from the hen (<i lang=
"gv">T&rsquo;eh er goaill fedjag ass y chiark</i>); so it would seem
that there must be such a scramble to get at the hen, and to take part
in the plucking, that it requires a certain amount of drink to allay
the thirst of the over zealous devotees of St. Catherine. But why
should this ceremony be associated with St. Catherine? and what were
the origin and meaning of it? These are questions on which I should be
glad to have light shed.</p>
<p>Manx has a word <i>quaail</i> (Irish <i>comhdh&aacute;il</i>),
meaning a &lsquo;meeting,&rsquo; and from it we have a derivative
<i>quaaltagh</i> or <i>qualtagh</i>, meaning, according to
Kelly&rsquo;s <i>Dictionary</i>, &lsquo;the first person or creature
one meets going from home,&rsquo; whereby the author can have only
meant the first met by one who is going from home. Kelly goes on to add
that &lsquo;this person is of great consequence to the superstitious,
particularly to women the first time they go out after lying-in.&rsquo;
Cregeen, in his <i>Dictionary</i>, defines the <i>qualtagh</i> as
&lsquo;the first person met on New Year&rsquo;s Day, or on going on
some new work, &amp;c.&rsquo; Before proceeding to give the substance
of my notes on the <i>qualtagh</i> of the present day I may as well
finish with Cregeen, for he adds the following
information:&mdash;&lsquo;A company of young lads or men generally went
in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb337" href="#pb337" name=
"pb337">337</a>]</span>old times on what they termed the
<i>qualtagh</i>, at Christmas or New Year&rsquo;s Day, to the houses of
their more wealthy neighbours; some one of the company repeating in an
audible voice the following rhyme:&mdash;</p>
<div lang="gv" class="lgouter">
<p class="line"><i>Ollick ghennal erriu as ble&iuml;n feer vie,</i></p>

<p class="line">Die like a mouse in a barn or haggard;</p>

</div>
<p class="first">At present New Year&rsquo;s Day is the time when the
<i>qualtagh</i> is of general interest, and in this case he is, outside
the members of one&rsquo;s own household, practically the first person
one sees on the morning of that day, whether that person meets one out
of doors or comes to one&rsquo;s house. The following is what I have
learnt by inquiry as to the <i>qualtagh</i>: all are agreed that he
must not be a woman or girl, and that he must not be <i>spaagagh</i> or
splay footed, while a woman from the parish of Marown told me that he
must not have red hair. The prevalent belief, however, is that he
should be a dark haired man or boy, and it is of no consequence how
rough his appearance may be, provided he be black haired. However, I
was told by one man in Rushen that the <i>qualtagh</i> or
&lsquo;first-foot&rsquo; need not be <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb338" href="#pb338" name="pb338">338</a>]</span>a black haired
person: he must be a man or boy. But this less restricted view is not
the one held in the central and northern parts of the island, so far as
I could ascertain. An English lady living in the neighbourhood of
Castletown told me that her son, whom I know to be, like his mother, a
blond, not being aware what consequences might be associated with his
visit, called at a house in Castletown on the morning of New
Year&rsquo;s Day, and he chanced to be the <i>qualtagh</i>. The
mistress of the house was horrified, and expressed to the English lady
her anticipation of misfortunes; and as it happened that one of the
children of the house died in the course of the year, the English lady
has been reminded of it since. Naturally the association of these
events are not pleasant to her; but, so far as I can remember, they
date only some eight or nine years ago<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e13764src" href="#xd25e13764" name="xd25e13764src">11</a>.</p>
<p>By way of bringing Wales into comparison with Man, I may mention
that, when I was a very small boy, I used to be sent very early on New
Year&rsquo;s morning to call on an old uncle of mine, because, as I was
told, I should be certain to receive a <i>calennig</i> or a
calends&rsquo; gift from him, but on no account would my sister be
allowed to go, as he would only see a boy on such an occasion as that.
I do not recollect anything being said as to the colour of one&rsquo;s
hair or the shape of one&rsquo;s foot; but that sort of negative
evidence is of very little value, as the <i>qualtagh</i> was fast
passing out of consideration.</p>
<p>The preference here given to a boy over a girl looks like one of the
widely spread superstitions which rule against the fair sex; but, as to
the colour of the hair, I should be predisposed to think that it
possibly rests <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb339" href="#pb339" name=
"pb339">339</a>]</span>on racial antipathy, long ago forgotten; for it
might perhaps be regarded as going back to a time when the dark haired
race reckoned the Aryan of fair complexion as his natural enemy, the
very sight of whom brought with it thoughts calculated to make him
unhappy and despondent. If this idea proved to be approximately
correct, one might suggest that the racial distinction in question
referred to the struggles between the inhabitants of Man and their
Scandinavian conquerors; but to my thinking it is just as likely that
it goes much further back.</p>
<p>Lastly, what is one to say with regard to the <i>spaagagh</i> or
splay footed person, now more usually defined as flat footed or having
no instep? I have heard it said in the south of the island that it is
unlucky to meet a <i>spaagagh</i> in the morning at any time of the
year, and not on New Year&rsquo;s Day alone; but this does not help us
in the attempt to find the genesis of this belief. If it were said that
it was unlucky to meet a deformed person, it would look somewhat more
natural; but why fix on the flat footed especially? For my part I have
not been trained to distinguish flat footed people, so I do not
recollect noticing any in the Isle of Man; but, granting there may be a
small proportion of such people in the island, does it not seem strange
that they should have their importance so magnified as this
superstition would seem to imply? I must confess that I cannot
understand it, unless we have here also some supposed racial
characteristic, let us say greatly exaggerated. To explain myself I
should put it that the non-Aryan aborigines were a small people of
great agility and nimbleness, and that their Aryan conquerors moved
more slowly and deliberately, whence the former, of springier
movements, might come to nickname the latter the flat footed. It is
even conceivable that there was some <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb340" href="#pb340" name="pb340">340</a>]</span>amount of foundation
for it in fact. If I might speak from my own experience, I might
mention a difficulty I have often had with shoes of English make,
namely, that I have always found them, unless made to measure, apt to
have their instep too low for me. It has never occurred to me to buy
ready-made shoes in France or Germany, but I know a lady as Welsh as I
am, who has often bought shoes in France, and her experience is, that
it is much easier for her to get shoes there to fit her than in
England, and for the very reason which I have already suggested,
namely, that the instep in English shoes is lower than in French
ones.</p>
<p>Again, I may mention that one day last term<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e13794src" href="#xd25e13794" name="xd25e13794src">12</a>, having
to address a meeting of Welsh undergraduates on folklore, I ventured to
introduce this question. They agreed with me that English shoes did
not, as a rule, fit Welsh feet, and this because they are made too low
in the instep: I ought to have said that they all agreed except one
undergraduate, who held his peace. He is a tall man, powerful in the
football field, but of no dark complexion, and I have never dared to
look in the direction of his feet since, lest he should catch me
carrying my comparisons to cruel extremes. Perhaps the flatness of the
feet of the one race is not emphasized so much as the height of the
instep in those of the other. At any rate I find this way of looking at
the question somewhat countenanced by a journalist who refers his
readers to Wm. Henderson&rsquo;s notes on the <i>Folklore of the
Northern Counties</i>, p. 74. The passage relates more particularly to
Northumberland, and runs as follows:&mdash;&lsquo;In some districts,
however, special weight is attached to the &ldquo;first-foot&rdquo;
being that of a person with a high-arched instep, a foot that
&ldquo;water runs under.&rdquo; A flat-footed person would bring great
ill-luck for the coming year.&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb341" href="#pb341" name="pb341">341</a>]</span></p>
<p>These instances do not warrant the induction that Celts are higher
in the instep than Teutons, and that they have inherited that
characteristic from the non-Aryan element in their ancestry. Perhaps
the explanation is, at least in part, that the dwellers in hilly
regions tend to be more springy and to have higher insteps than the
inhabitants of flatter lands. The statement of Dr. Karl Blind on this
point does not help one to a decision when he speaks as follows in
<i>Folk-Lore</i> for 1892, p. 89:&mdash;&lsquo;As to the instep, I can
speak from personal experience. Almost every German finds that an
English shoemaker makes his boots not high enough in the instep. The
northern Germans (I am from the south) have perhaps slightly flatter
feet than the southern Germans.&rsquo; The first part of the comparison
is somewhat of a surprise to me, but not so the other part, that the
southern Germans inhabiting a hillier country, and belonging to a
different race, may well be higher in the instep than the more northern
speakers of the German language. But on the whole the more one examines
the <i>qualtagh</i>, the less clearly one sees how he can be the
representative of a particular race. More data possibly would enable
one to arrive at greater probability.</p>
<p>There is one other question which I should like to ask before
leaving the <i>qualtagh</i>, namely, as to the relation of the custom
of New Year&rsquo;s gifts to the belief in the <i>qualtagh</i>. I have
heard it related in the Isle of Man that women have been known to keep
indoors on New Year&rsquo;s Day until the <i>qualtagh</i> comes, which
sometimes means their being prisoners for the greater part of the day,
in order to avoid the risk of first meeting one who is not of the right
sex and complexion. On the other hand, when the <i>qualtagh</i> is of
the right description, considerable fuss is made of him; to say the
least, he has to accept food and drink, possibly more permanent
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb342" href="#pb342" name=
"pb342">342</a>]</span>gifts. Thus a tall, black haired native of Kirk
Michael described to me how he chanced on New Year&rsquo;s Day, years
ago, to turn into a lonely cottage in order to light his pipe, and how
he found he was the <i>qualtagh</i>: he had to sit down to have food,
and when he went away it was with a present and the blessings of the
family. Now New Year&rsquo;s Day is the time for gifts in Wales, as
shown by the name for them, <i>calennig</i>, which is derived from
<i>calan</i>, the Welsh form of the Latin <i>calend&aelig;</i>, New
Year&rsquo;s Day being in Welsh <i>Y Calan</i>, &lsquo;the
Calends.&rsquo; The same is the day for gifts in Scotland and in
Ireland, except in so far as Christmas boxes have been making inroads
from England: I need not add that the <i>Jour de l&rsquo;An</i> is the
day for gifts also in France. My question then is this: Is there any
essential connexion of origin between the institution of New
Year&rsquo;s Day gifts and the belief in the first-foot?</p>
<p>Now that it has been indicated what sort of a <i>qualtagh</i> it is
unlucky to have, I may as well proceed to mention the other things
which I have heard treated as unlucky in the island. Some of them
scarcely require to be noticed, as there is nothing specially Manx
about them, such as the belief that it is unlucky to have the first
glimpse of the new moon through glass. That is a superstition which is,
I believe, widely spread, and, among other countries, it is quite
familiar in Wales, where it is also unlucky to see the moon for the
first time through a hedge or over a house. What this means I cannot
guess, unless it be that it was once considered one&rsquo;s duty to
watch the first appearance of the new moon from the highest point in
the landscape of the district in which one dwelt. Such a point would in
that case become the chief centre of a moon worship now lost in
oblivion.</p>
<p>It is believed in Man, as it used to be in Wales and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb343" href="#pb343" name=
"pb343">343</a>]</span>Ireland, that it is unlucky to disturb
antiquities, especially old burial places and old churches. This
superstition is unfortunately passing away in all three countries, but
you still hear of it, especially in the Isle of Man, mostly after
mischief has been done. Thus a good Manx scholar told me how a relative
of his in the Ronnag, a small valley near South Barrule, had carted
away the earth from an old burial ground on his farm and used it as
manure for his fields, and how his beasts died afterwards. The narrator
said he did not know whether there was any truth in it, but everybody
believed that it was the reason why the cattle died; and so did the
farmer himself at last: so he desisted from completing his disturbance
of the old site. It is possibly for a similar reason that a house in
ruins is seldom pulled down, or the materials used for other buildings.
Where that has been done misfortunes have ensued; at any rate, I have
heard it said so more than once. I ought to have stated that the
non-disturbance of antiquities in the island is quite consistent with
their being now and then shamefully neglected as elsewhere. This is now
met by an excellent statute recently enacted by the House of Keys for
the preservation of the public monuments of the island.</p>
<p>Of the other and more purely Manx superstitions I may mention one
which obtains among the Peel fishermen of the present day: no boat is
willing to be third in the order of sailing out from Peel harbour to
the fisheries. So it sometimes happens that after two boats have
departed, the others remain watching each other for days, each hoping
that somebody else may be reckless enough to break through the
invisible barrier of &lsquo;bad luck.&rsquo; I have often asked for an
explanation of this superstition, but the only intelligible answer I
have had was that it has been observed that the third boat <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb344" href="#pb344" name="pb344">344</a>]</span>has
done badly several years in succession; but I am unable to ascertain
how far that represents the fact. Another of the unlucky things is to
have a white stone in the boat, even in the ballast, and for that I
never could get any explanation at all; but there is no doubt as to the
fact of this superstition, and I may illustrate it from the case of a
clergyman&rsquo;s son on the west side, who took it into his head to go
out with some fishermen several days in succession. They chanced to be
unsuccessful each time, and they gave their Jonah the nickname of
<i>Clagh Vane</i>, or &lsquo;White Stone.&rsquo; Now what can be the
origin of this tabu? It seems to me that if the Manx had once a habit
of adorning the graves of the departed with white stones, that
circumstance would be a reasonable explanation of the superstition in
question. Further, it is quite possible they did, and here Manx
arch&aelig;ologists could probably help as to the matter of fact. In
the absence, however, of information to the point from Man, I take the
liberty of citing some relating to Scotland. It comes from Mr.
Gomme&rsquo;s presidential address to the Folk-Lore Society: see
<i>Folk-Lore</i> for 1893, pp. 13&ndash;4:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Near Inverary, it is the custom among the fisher-folk, and
has been so within the memory of the oldest, to place little white
stones or pebbles on the graves of their friends. No reason is now
given for the practice, beyond that most potent and delightful of all
reasons in the minds of folk-lore students, namely, that it has always
been done. Now there is nothing between this modern practice sanctioned
by traditional observance and the practice of the stone-age people in
the same neighbourhood and in others, as made known to us by their
grave-relics. Thus, in a cairn at Achnacrie opened by Dr. Angus Smith,
on entering the innermost chamber &ldquo;the first thing that struck
the eye was a row of quartz <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb345" href=
"#pb345" name="pb345">345</a>]</span>pebbles larger than a walnut;
these were arranged on the ledge of the lower granite block of the east
side.&rdquo; Near Crinan, at Duncraigaig and at Rudie, the same
characteristic was observed, and Canon Greenwell, who examined the
cairns, says the pebbles &ldquo;must have been placed there with some
intention, and probably possessed a symbolic
meaning.&rdquo;&#8202;&rsquo; See also <i>Burghead</i>, by Mr. H. W.
Young (Inverness, 1899), p. 10, where we read that at Burghead the
&lsquo;smooth white pebbles, sometimes five or seven of them, but never
more,&rsquo; have been usually arranged as crosses on the graves which
he has found under the fallen ramparts. Can this be a Christian
superstition with the white stones of the Apocalypse as its
foundation?</p>
<p>Here I may mention a fact which I do not know where else to put,
namely, that a fisherman on his way in the morning to the fishing, and
chancing to pass by the cottage of another fisherman who is not on
friendly terms with him, will pluck a straw from the thatch of the
latter&rsquo;s dwelling. Thereby he is supposed to rob him of his luck
in the fishing for that day. One would expect to learn that the straw
from the thatch served as the subject of an incantation directed
against the owner of the thatch. I have never heard anything suggested
to that effect; but I conclude that the plucking of the straw is only a
partial survival of what was once a complete ritual for bewitching
one&rsquo;s neighbour, unless getting possession of the straw was
supposed to carry with it possession of everything belonging to the
other man, including his luck in fishing for that day.</p>
<p>Owing to my ignorance as to the superstitions of other fishermen
than those of the Isle of Man, I will not attempt to classify the
remaining instances to be mentioned, such as the unluckiness of
mentioning a horse or a mouse on board a fishing-boat: I seem,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb346" href="#pb346" name=
"pb346">346</a>]</span>however, to have heard of similar tabus among
Scottish fishermen; and, according to Dr. Blind, Shetland fishermen
will not mention a church or a clergyman when out at sea, but use quite
other names for both when on board a ship (<i>Folk-Lore</i> for 1892,
p. 89). Novices in the Manx fisheries have to learn not to point to
anything with one finger: they have to point with the whole hand or not
at all. This looks as if it belonged to a code of rules as to the use
of the hand, such as prevail among the Neapolitans and other peoples
whose chief article of faith is the belief in malign influences: see
Mr. Elworthy&rsquo;s volume on <i>The Evil Eye</i>.</p>
<p>Whether the Manx are alone in thinking it unlucky to lend salt from
one boat to another when they are engaged in the fishing, I know not:
such lending would probably be inconvenient, but why it should be
unlucky, as they believe it to be, does not appear. The first of May is
a day on which it is unlucky to lend anything, and especially to give
anyone fire<a class="noteref" id="xd25e13885src" href="#xd25e13885"
name="xd25e13885src">13</a>. This looks as if it pointed back to some
druidic custom of lighting all fires at that time from a sacred hearth,
but, so far as is known, this only took place at the beginning of the
other half-year, namely, <i>Sauin</i> or Allhallows, which is sometimes
rendered into Manx as <i>Laa &rsquo;ll mooar ny Saintsh</i>, &lsquo;the
Day of the great Feast of the Saints.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lastly, I may mention that it is unlucky to say that you are very
well: at any rate, I infer that it is regarded so, as you will never
get a Manxman to say that he is <i>feer vie</i>, &lsquo;very
well.&rsquo; He usually admits that he is &lsquo;middling&rsquo;; and
if by any chance he risks a stronger adjective, he hastens to qualify
it by adding &lsquo;now,&rsquo; or &lsquo;just now,&rsquo; with an
emphasis indicative of his anxiety not to say <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb347" href="#pb347" name="pb347">347</a>]</span>too
much. His habits of speech point back to a time when the Manx mind was
dominated by the fear of awaking malignant influences in the spirit
world around him. This has had the effect of giving the Manx
peasant&rsquo;s character a tinge of reserve and suspicion, which makes
it difficult to gain his confidence: his acquaintance has, therefore,
to be cultivated for some time before you can say that you know the
workings of his heart. The pagan belief in a Nemesis has doubtless
passed away, but not without materially affecting the Manx idea of a
personal devil. Ever since the first allusion made in my hearing by
Manxmen to the devil, I have been more and more deeply impressed that
for them the devil is a much more formidable being than Englishmen or
Welshmen picture him. He is a graver and, if I may say so, a more
respectable being, allowing no liberties to be taken with his name, so
you had better not call him a devil, the evil one, or like names, for
his proper designation is <i>Noid ny Hanmey</i>, &lsquo;the Enemy of
the Soul,&rsquo; and in ordinary Anglo-Manx conversation he is commonly
called &lsquo;the Enemy of Souls.&rsquo; I well remember getting one
day into a conversation with an old soldier in the south of the island.
He was, as I soon discovered, labouring under a sort of theological
monomania, and his chief question was concerning the Welsh word for
&lsquo;the Enemy of Souls.&rsquo; I felt at once that I had to be
careful, and that the reputation of my countrymen depended on how I
answered. As I had no name anything like the one he used for the devil,
I explained to him that the Welsh, though not a great nation, were
great students of theology, and that they had by no means neglected the
great branch of it known as satanology. In fact that study, as I went
on to say, had left its impress on the Welsh language: on Sunday the
ministers of all denominations, the deacons <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb348" href="#pb348" name="pb348">348</a>]</span>and
elders, and all self-respecting congregations spoke of the devil
trisyllabically as <i>diafol</i>, while on the other days of the week
everybody called him more briefly and forcibly <i>diawl</i>, except
bards concocting an <i>awdl</i> for an Eiste&#273;fod, where the devil
must always be called <i>diafl</i>, and excepting also sailors, farm
servants, post-boys and colliers, together with country gentlemen
learning Welsh to address their wouldn&rsquo;t-be
constituents&mdash;for all these the regulation form was <i>jawl</i>,
with an English <i>j</i>. Thus one could, I pointed out to him, fix the
social standing of a Welshman by the way he named &lsquo;the Enemy of
Souls,&rsquo; as well as appreciate the superiority of Welsh over
Greek, seeing that Welsh, when it borrowed <span class="trans" title=
"diabolos"><span class="Greek" lang=
"grc">&delta;&iota;&#8049;&beta;&omicron;&lambda;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span></span>
from Greek, quadrupled it, while Greek remained sterile. He was so
profoundly impressed that I never was able to bring his attention back
to the small fry, spiritually speaking, of the Isle of Man, to wit, the
fairies and the fenodyree, or even the witches and the charmers, except
that he had some reserve of faith in witches, since the witch of Endor
was in the Bible and had ascribed to her a &lsquo;terr&rsquo;ble&rsquo;
great power of raising spirits: that, he thought, must be true. I
pointed out to him that a fenodyree (see p. 288) was also mentioned in
his Bible: this display of ready knowledge on my part made a deep
impression on his mind.</p>
<p>The Manx are, as a rule, a sober people, and highly religious; as
regards their tenets, they are mostly members of the Church of England
or Wesleyan Methodists, or else both, which is by no means unusual.
Religious phrases are not rare in their ordinary conversation; in fact,
they struck me as being of more frequent occurrence than in Wales, even
the Wales of my boyhood; and here and there this fondness for religious
phraseology has left its traces on the native vocabulary. Take, for
example, the word for &lsquo;anybody, a person, or human <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb349" href="#pb349" name=
"pb349">349</a>]</span>being,&rsquo; which Cregeen writes
<i>py&rsquo;agh</i> or <i>p&rsquo;agh</i>: he rightly regards it as the
colloquial pronunciation of <i>peccagh</i>, &lsquo;a sinner.&rsquo; So,
when one knocks at a Manx door and calls out, <i>Vel p&rsquo;agh
sthie</i>? he literally asks, &lsquo;Is there any sinner
indoors?&rsquo; The question has, however, been explained to me, with
unconscious irony, as properly meaning, &lsquo;Is there any Christian
indoors?&rsquo; and care is now taken in reading to pronounce the
middle consonants of the word <i>peccagh</i>, &lsquo;sinner,&rsquo; so
as to distinguish it from the word for a Christian
&lsquo;anybody&rsquo;: but the identity of origin is unmistakable.</p>
<p>Lastly, the fact that a curse is a species of prayer, to wit, a
prayer for evil to follow, is well exemplified in Manx by the same
words, <i>gwee</i><a class="noteref" id="xd25e13960src" href=
"#xd25e13960" name="xd25e13960src">14</a>, plural <i>gwecaghyn</i>,
meaning both kinds of prayer. Thus I found myself stumbling several
times, in reading through the Psalms in Manx, from not bearing in mind
the sinister meaning of these words; for example in Psalm xiv. 6, where
we have <i>Ta &rsquo;n beeal oc lane dy ghweeaghyn as dy herriuid</i>,
which I mechanically construed to mean &lsquo;Their mouth is full of
praying and bitterness,&rsquo; instead of &lsquo;cursing and
bitterness&rsquo;; and so in other cases, such as Ps. x. 7, and cix.
27.</p>
<p>It occurred to me on various occasions to make inquiries as to the
attitude of religious Manxmen towards witchcraft and the
charmer&rsquo;s vocation. Nobody, so far as I know, accuses them of
favouring witchcraft in any way whatsoever; but as to the reality of
witches and witchcraft they are not likely to have any doubts so long
as they dwell on the Biblical account of the witch of Endor, as I have
already mentioned in the case of the old Crimean soldier. Then as to
charmers <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb350" href="#pb350" name=
"pb350">350</a>]</span>I have heard it distinctly stated that the most
religious men are they who have most confidence in charmers and their
charms; and a lay preacher whom I know has been mentioned to me as now
and then doing a little charming in cases of danger or pressing need.
On the whole, I think the charge against religious people of consulting
charmers is somewhat exaggerated; but I believe that recourse to the
charmer is more usual and more openly had than, for example, in Wales,
where those who consult a <i>dyn hyspys</i> or &lsquo;wise man&rsquo;
have to do it secretly, and at the risk of being expelled by their
co-religionists from the <i>Seiet</i> or &lsquo;Society.&rsquo; There
is somewhat in the atmosphere of Man to remind one rather of the Wales
of a past generation&mdash;Wales as it was at the time when the Rev.
Edmund Jones could write a <i>Relation of Apparitions of Spirits in the
County of Monmouth and the Principality of Wales</i>, as a book
&lsquo;designed to confute and to prevent the infidelity of denying the
being and apparition of spirits, which tends to irreligion and
atheism&rsquo;: see pp. 174, 195 above.</p>
<p>The Manx peasantry are perhaps the most independent and prosperous
in the British Isles; but their position geographically and politically
has been favourable to the continuance of ideas not quite up to the
level of the latest papers on Darwinism and Evolution read at our
Church Congresses in this country. This may be thought to be here wide
of the mark; but, after giving, in the previous chapter, specimens of
rather ancient superstitions as recently known in the island, it is but
right that one should form an idea of the surroundings in which they
have lingered into modern times. Perhaps nothing will better serve to
bring this home to the reader&rsquo;s mind than the fact, for which
there is proof, that old people still living remember men and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb351" href="#pb351" name=
"pb351">351</a>]</span>women clad in white sheets doing penance
publicly in the churches of Man.</p>
<p>The following is the evidence which I was able to find, and I may
state that I first heard in 1888 of the public penance from Mr.
Joughin, who was an aged man and a native of Kirk Bride. He related how
a girl named Mary Dick gave an impertinent answer to the clergyman when
he was catechizing her class, and how she had to do penance for it at
church. She took her revenge on the parson by singing, while attending
in a white sheet, louder than everybody else in the congregation. This,
unless I am mistaken, Mr. Joughin gave me to understand he had heard
from his father. I mentioned the story to a clergyman, who was
decidedly of opinion that no one alive now could remember anything
about public penance. Not long after, however, I got into conversation
with a shoemaker at Kirk Michael, named Dan Kelly, who was nearly
completing his eighty-first year. He was a native of Ballaugh, and
stated that he remembered many successive occupants of the episcopal
see. A long time ago the official called the sumner had, out of spite
he said, appointed him to serve as one of the four of the chapter jury.
It was, he thought, when he was about twenty-five. During his term of
office he saw four persons, of whom two were married men and two
unmarried women, doing penance in the parish church of Ballaugh for
having illegitimate children. They stood in the alley of the church,
and the sumner had to throw white sheets over them; on the fourth
Sunday of their penance they stood inside the chancel rails, but not to
take the communion. The parson, whose name was Stowell or Stowall, made
them thoroughly ashamed of themselves on the fourth Sunday, as one of
the men afterwards admitted. Kelly mentioned the names of the women and
of one of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb352" href="#pb352" name=
"pb352">352</a>]</span>men, and he indicated to me some of their
descendants as well known in the neighbourhood. I cross-examined him
all the more severely, as I had heard the other view of the remoteness
of the date. But nothing could shake Kelly, who added that soon after
the date of the above mentioned cases the civil functionary, known as
the vicar-general, put an end to the chapter jury and to public
penance: according to his reckoning the penance he spoke of must have
taken place about 1832. Another old man, named Kewley, living now near
Kirk Michael, but formerly in the parish of Lezayre, had a similar
story. He thinks that he was born in the sixth year of the century, and
when he was between eighteen and twenty he saw a man doing public
penance, in Lezayre Church, I presume, but I have no decided note on
that point. However that may be, he remembered that the penitent, when
he had done his penance, had the audacity to throw the white sheet over
the sumner, who, the penitent remarked, might now wear it himself, as
he had had enough of it. Kewley would bring the date only down to about
1825.</p>
<p>Lastly, I was in the island again in 1891, and spent the first part
of the month of April at Peel, where I had conversations with a retired
captain who was then about seventy-eight. He is a native of the parish
of Dalby, but he was only &lsquo;a lump of a boy&rsquo; when the last
couple of immorals were forced to do penance in white sheets at church.
He gave me the guilty man&rsquo;s name, and the name of his home in the
parish, and both the captain and his daughter assured me that the man
had only been dead six or seven years; that is, the penitent seems to
have lived till about the year 1884. I may here mention that the parish
of Dalby is the subject of many tales, which go to show that its people
were more old-fashioned in their ways than those of the rest of the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb353" href="#pb353" name=
"pb353">353</a>]</span>island. It appears to have been the last, also,
to be reached by a cart road; and I was amused by a native&rsquo;s
description of the men at Methodist meetings in Dalby pulling the
<i>tappag</i>, or forelock, at the name of Jesus, while the women
ducked a curtsy in a dangerously abrupt fashion. He and his wife
appeared to be quite used to it: the husband was an octogenarian named
Quirc, who was born on the coast near the low-lying peninsula called
the <span class="corr" id="xd25e14003" title=
"Source: Narbyl">Niarbyl</span>, that is to say &lsquo;the
Tail.&rsquo;</p>
<p>To return to the public penance, it seems to us in this country to
belong, so to say, to ancient history, and it transports us to a state
of things which we find it hard to realize. The lapse of years has
brought about profounder changes in our greater Isle of Britain than in
the smaller Isle of Man, while we ourselves, helpless to escape the
pervading influence of those profounder changes, become living
instances of the comprehensive truth of the German poet&rsquo;s
words,</p>

may turn out to be all wrong; for I learn from the Rev. John Quine,
vicar of Malew, in Man, that there is a farm called Balthane or
Bolthane south of Ballasalla, and that in the computus (of 1540) of the
Abbey Tenants it is called <i>Biulthan</i>. This last, if originally a
man&rsquo;s name, would <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb334n" href=

a compound as <i>Beo-Ult&aacute;n</i>. In his <i>Manx Names</i>, p.

<i>bwoailtyn</i>, &lsquo;folds or pens&rsquo;; but the accentuation
places that out of the question. See also the <i>Lioar Manninagh</i>,
iii. 167, where Mr. C. Roeder, referring to the same computus passage,
gives the name as <i>Builthan</i> in the boundary <i>inter Cross Jvar
Builthan</i>. This would be read by Mr. Quine as <i>inter Cross

<p class="first">It is only recently<a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e14028src" href="#xd25e14028" name="xd25e14028src">1</a> that I
heard for the first time of Welsh instances of the habit of tying rags
and bits of clothing to the branches of a tree growing near a holy
well. Since then I have obtained several items of information in point:
the first is a communication received in June, 1892, from Mr. J. H.
Davies, of Lincoln College, Oxford&mdash;since then of Lincoln&rsquo;s
Inn&mdash;relating to a Glamorganshire holy well, situated near the
pathway leading from Coychurch to Bridgend. It is the custom there, he
states, for people suffering from any malady to dip a rag in the water,
and to bathe the affected part of the body, the rag being then placed
on a tree close to the well. When Mr. Davies passed that way, some
three years previously, there were, he adds, hundreds of such shreds on
the tree, some of which distinctly presented the appearance of having
been very recently placed there. The well is called Ffynnon Cae Moch,
&lsquo;Swine-field Well,&rsquo; which can hardly have been its old
name; and a later communication from Mr. Davies summarizes a
conversation which he had about the well, on December 16, 1892, with
Mr. J. T. Howell, of Pencoed, near Bridgend. His notes run
thus:&mdash;&lsquo;<i>Ffynnon Cae Moch</i>, between Coychurch and
Bridgend, is one <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb355" href="#pb355"
name="pb355">355</a>]</span>mile from Coychurch, one and a quarter from
Bridgend, near Tremains. It is within twelve or fifteen yards of the
high-road, just where the pathway begins. People suffering from
rheumatism go there. They bathe the part affected with water, and
afterwards tie a piece of rag to the tree which overhangs the well. The
rag is not put in the water at all, but is only put on the tree for
luck. It is a stunted, but very old tree, and is simply <i>covered</i>
with rags.&rsquo; A little less than a year later, I had an opportunity
of visiting this well in the company of Mr. Brynmor-Jones; and I find
in my notes that it is not situated so near the road as Mr. Howell
would seem to have stated to Mr. Davies. We found the well, which is a
powerful spring, surrounded by a circular wall. It is overshadowed by a
dying thorn tree, and a little further back stands another thorn which
is not so decayed: it was on this latter thorn we found the rags. I
took off a twig with two rags, while Mr. Brynmor-Jones counted over a
dozen other rags on the tree; and we noticed that some of them had only
recently been suspended there: among them were portions undoubtedly of
a woman&rsquo;s clothing. At one of the hotels at Bridgend, I found an
illiterate servant who was acquainted with the well, and I
cross-examined him on the subject of it. He stated that a man with a
wound, which he explained to mean a cut, would go and stand in the well
within the wall, and there he would untie the rag that had been used to
tie up the wound and would wash the wound with it: then he would tie up
the wound with a fresh rag and hang the old one on the tree. The more
respectable people whom I questioned talked more vaguely, and only of
tying a rag to the tree, except one who mentioned a pin being thrown
into the well <i>or</i> a rag being tied to the tree.</p>
<p>My next informant is Mr. D. J. Jones, a native of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb356" href="#pb356" name=
"pb356">356</a>]</span>Rhon&#273;a Valley, in the same county of
Glamorgan. He was an undergraduate of Jesus College, Oxford, when I
consulted him in 1892. His information was to the effect that he knows
of three interesting wells in the county. The first is situated within
two miles of his home, and is known as <i>Ffynnon Pen Rhys</i>, or the
Well of Pen Rhys. The custom there is that the person who wishes his
health to be benefited should wash in the water of the well, and throw
a pin into it afterwards. He next mentions a well at &#7930;ancarvan,
some five or six miles from Cowbridge, where the custom prevails of
tying rags to the branches of a tree growing close at hand. Lastly, he
calls my attention to a passage in <i>Hanes Morganwg</i>, &lsquo;The
History of Glamorgan,&rsquo; written by Mr. D. W. Jones, known in Welsh
literature as Dafy&#273; Morganwg. In that work, p. 29, the author
speaks of <i>Ffynnon Marcros</i>, &lsquo;the Well of Marcros,&rsquo; to
the following effect:&mdash;&lsquo;It is the custom for those who are
healed in it to tie a shred of linen or cotton to the branches of a
tree that stands close by; and there the shreds are, almost as numerous
as the leaves.&rsquo; Marcros is, I may say, near Nash Point, and looks
on the map as if it were about eight miles distant from Bridgend. Let
me here make it clear that so far we have had to do with four different
wells<a class="noteref" id="xd25e14055src" href="#xd25e14055" name=
"xd25e14055src">2</a>, three of which are severally distinguished by
the presence of a tree adorned with rags by those who seek health in
those waters; but they are all three, as the reader will have doubtless
noticed, in the same district, namely, the part of Glamorganshire near
the main line of the Great Western Railway.</p>
<p>There is no reason, however, to think that the custom of tying rags
to a well tree was peculiar to that part of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb357" href="#pb357" name="pb357">357</a>]</span>the
Principality. One day, in looking through some old notes of mine, I
came across an entry bearing the date of August 7, 1887, when I was
spending a few days with my friend, Chancellor Silvan Evans, at
&#7930;anwrin Rectory, near Machyn&#7931;eth. Mrs. Evans was then alive
and well, and took a keen interest in Welsh antiquities and folklore.
Among other things, she related to me how she had, some twenty years
before, visited a well in the parish of &#7930;andri&#7931;o yn Rhos,
namely <i>Ffynnon Eilian</i>, or Elian&rsquo;s Well, between Abergele
and &#7930;andudno, when her attention was directed to some bushes near
the well, which had once been covered with bits of rags left by those
who frequented the well. This was told Mrs. Evans by an old woman of
seventy, who, on being questioned by Mrs. Evans concerning the history
of the well, informed her that the rags used to be tied to the bushes
by means of wool. She was explicit on the point, that wool had to be
used for the purpose, and that even woollen yarn would not do: it had
to be wool in its natural state. The old woman remembered this to have
been the rule ever since she was a child. Mrs. Evans noticed corks,
with pins stuck in them, floating in the well, and her informant
remembered many more in years gone by; for Elian&rsquo;s Well was once
in great repute as a <i>ffynnon reibio</i>, or a well to which people
resorted for the kindly purpose of bewitching those whom they hated. I
infer, however, from what Mrs. Evans was told of the rags, that
Elian&rsquo;s Well was visited, not only by the malicious, but also by
the sick and suffering. My note is not clear on the point whether there
were any rags on the bushes by the well when Mrs. Evans visited the
spot, or whether she was only told of them by the caretaker. Even in
the latter case it seems evident that this habit of tying rags to trees
or bushes near sacred wells has only <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb358" href="#pb358" name="pb358">358</a>]</span>ceased in that part
of Denbighshire within this century. It is very possible that it
continued in North Wales more recently than this instance would lead
one to suppose; indeed, I should not be in the least surprised to learn
that it is still practised in out of the way places in Gwyne&#273;,
just as it is in Glamorgan: we want more information.</p>
<p>I cannot say for certain whether it was customary in any of the
cases to which I have called attention to tie rags to the well tree as
well as to throw pins or other small objects into the well; but I
cannot help adhering to the view, that the distinction was probably an
ancient one between two orders of things. In other words, I am inclined
to believe that the rag was regarded as the vehicle of the disease of
which the ailing visitor to the well wished to be rid, and that the
bead, button, or coin deposited by him in the well, or in a receptacle
near the well, formed alone the offering. In opposition to this view
Mr. Gomme has expressed himself as follows in <i>Folk-Lore</i>, 1892,
p. 89:&mdash;&lsquo;There is some evidence against that, from the fact
that in the case of some wells, especially in Scotland at one time, the
whole garment was put down as an offering. Gradually these offerings of
clothes became less and less till they came down to rags. Also in other
parts, the geographical distribution of rag-offerings coincides with
the existence of monoliths and dolmens.&rsquo; As to the monoliths and
dolmens, I am too little conversant with the facts to risk any opinion
as to the value of the coincidence; but as to the suggestion that the
rag originally meant the whole garment, that will suit my hypothesis
admirably. In other words, the whole garment was, as I take it, the
vehicle of the disease: the whole was accursed, and not merely a part.
But Mr. Gomme had previously touched on the question in his
presidential address (<i>Folk-Lore</i> for 1892, p. 13); and I must
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb359" href="#pb359" name=
"pb359">359</a>]</span>at once admit that he succeeded then in proving
that a certain amount of confusion occurs between things which I should
regard as belonging originally to distinct categories: witness the
inimitable Irish instance which he quotes:&mdash;&lsquo;To St.
Columbkill&mdash;I offer up this button, a bit o&rsquo; the waistband
o&rsquo; my own breeches, an&rsquo; a taste o&rsquo; my wife&rsquo;s
petticoat, in remimbrance of us havin&rsquo; made this holy station;
an&rsquo; may they rise up in glory to prove it for us in the last
day.&rsquo; Here not only the button is treated as an offering, but
also the bits of clothing; but the confusion of ideas I should explain
as being, at least in part, one of the natural results of substituting
a portion of a garment for the entire garment; for thereby a button or
a pin becomes a part of the dress, and capable of being interpreted in
two senses. After all, however, the ordinary practices have not, as I
look at them, resulted in effacing the distinction altogether: the rag
is not left in the well; nor is the bead, button, or pin attached to a
branch of the tree. So, in the main, it seemed to me easier to explain
the facts, taken altogether, on the supposition that originally the rag
was regarded as the vehicle of the disease, and the bead, button, or
coin as the offering. My object in calling attention to this point was
to have it discussed, and I am happy to say that I have not been
disappointed; for, since my remarks were published<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e14083src" href="#xd25e14083" name="xd25e14083src">3</a>, a
paper entitled <i>Pin-wells and Rag-bushes</i> was read before the
British Association by Mr. Hartland, in 1893, and published in
<i>Folk-Lore</i> for the same year, pp. 451&ndash;70. In that paper the
whole question is gone into with searching logic, and Mr. Hartland
finds the required explanation in one of the dogmas of magic. For
&lsquo;if an article of my clothing,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;in a
witch&rsquo;s hands may cause me to suffer, the same article in contact
with a beneficent power may relieve my pain, restore me to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb360" href="#pb360" name=
"pb360">360</a>]</span>health, or promote my general prosperity. A pin
that has pricked my wart &hellip; has by its contact, by the wound it
has inflicted, acquired a peculiar bond with the wart; the rag that has
rubbed the wart has by that friction acquired a similar bond; so that
whatever is done to the pin or the rag, whatever influences the pin or
the rag may undergo, the same influences are by that very act brought
to bear, upon the wart. If, instead of using a rag, or making a
pilgrimage to a sacred well, I rub my warts with raw meat and then bury
the meat, the wart will decay and disappear with the decay and
dissolution of the meat&#8202;&hellip;. In like manner my shirt or
stocking, or a rag to represent it, placed upon a sacred bush, or
thrust into a sacred well&mdash;my name written upon the walls of a
temple&mdash;a stone or a pellet from my hand cast upon a sacred image
or a sacred cairn&mdash;is thenceforth in continual contact with
divinity; and the effluence of divinity, reaching and involving it,
will reach and involve me.&rsquo; Mr. Hartland concludes from a large
number of instances, that as a rule &lsquo;where the pin or button is
dropped into the well, the patient does not trouble about the rag, and
vice versa.&rsquo; This wider argument as to the effluence of the
divinity of a particular spot of special holiness seems to me
conclusive. It applies also, needless to say, to a large category of
cases besides those in question between Mr. Gomme and the present
writer.</p>
<p>So now I would revise my position thus:&mdash;I continue to regard
the rag much as before, but treat the article thrown into the well as
the more special means of establishing a beneficial relation with the
well divinity: whether it could also be viewed as an offering would
depend on the value attached to it. Some of the following notes may
serve as illustrations, especially those relating to the wool and the
pin:&mdash;<i>Ffynnon <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb361" href=
"#pb361" name="pb361">361</a>]</span>Gwynwy</i>, or the Well of Gwynwy,
near &#7930;angelynin, on the river Conwy, appears to be partly in
point; for it formerly used to be well stocked with crooked pins, which
nobody would touch lest he might get from them the warts supposed to
attach to them, whence it would appear that a pin might be regarded as
the vehicle of the disease. There was a well of some repute at Cae
Garw, in the parish of Pisty&#7931;, near the foot of Carnguwch, in
&#7930;eyn, or West Carnarvonshire. The water possessed virtues to cure
one of rheumatism and warts; but, in order to be rid of the latter, it
was requisite to throw a pin into the well for each individual wart.
For these two items of information, and several more to be mentioned
presently, I have to thank Mr. John Jones, better known in Wales by his
bardic name of Myr&#273;in Far&#273;, and as an enthusiastic collector
of Welsh antiquities, whether in the form of manuscript or of unwritten
folklore. On the second day of the year 1893 I paid him a visit at
Chwilog, on the Carnarvon and Avon Wen Railway, and asked him many
questions: these he not only answered with the utmost willingness, but
he also showed me the unpublished materials which he had collected. I
come next to a competition on the folklore of North Wales at the London
Eiste&#273;fod in 1887, in which, as one of the adjudicators, I
observed that several of the competitors mentioned the prevalent
belief, that every well with healing properties must have its outlet
towards the south (<i>i&rsquo;r d&ecirc;</i>). According to one of
them, if you wished to get rid of warts, you should, on your way to the
well, look for wool which the sheep had lost. When you had found enough
wool you should prick each wart with a pin, and then rub the wart well
with the wool. The next thing was to bend the pin and throw it into the
well. Then you <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb362" href="#pb362" name=
"pb362">362</a>]</span>should place the wool on the first whitethorn
you could find, and as the wind scattered the wool, the warts would
disappear. There was a well of the kind, the writer went on to say,
near his home; and he, with three or four other boys, went from school
one day to the well to charm their warts away. For he had twenty-three
on one of his hands; so that he always tried to hide it, as it was the
belief that if one counted the warts they would double their number. He
forgets what became of the other boys&rsquo; warts, but his own
disappeared soon afterwards; and his grandfather used to maintain that
it was owing to the virtue of the well. Such were the words of this
writer, whose name is unknown to me; but I guess him to have been a
native of Carnarvonshire, or else of one of the neighbouring districts
of Denbighshire or Merionethshire. To return to Myr&#273;in Far&#273;,
he mentioned <i lang="cy">Ffynnon Cefn &#7930;eithfan</i>, or the Well
of the &#7930;eithfan Ridge, on the eastern slope of Myny&#273; y Rhiw,
in the parish of Bryncroes, in the west of &#7930;eyn. In the case of
this well it is necessary, when going to it and coming from it, to be
careful not to utter a word to anybody, or to turn to look back. What
one has to do at the well is to bathe the warts with a rag or clout
which has grease on it. When that is done, the clout with the grease
has to be carefully concealed beneath the stone at the mouth of the
well. This brings to my mind the fact that I noticed more than once,
years ago, rags underneath stones in the water flowing from wells in
Wales, and sometimes thrust into holes in the walls of wells, but I had
no notion how they came there.</p>
<p>On the subject of pin-wells I had in 1893, from Mr. T. E. Morris, of
Portmadoc, barrister-at-law, some account of <i>Ffynnon Faglan</i>, or
Baglan&rsquo;s Well, in the parish of &#7930;anfaglan, near Carnarvon.
The well is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb363" href="#pb363" name=
"pb363">363</a>]</span>situated in an open field to the right of the
road leading towards the church, and close to it. The church and
churchyard form an enclosure in the middle of the same field, and the
former has in its wall the old stone reading <span class="sc">FILI
LOVERNII ANATEMORI</span>. My friend derived information from Mrs.
Roberts, of Cefn y Coed, near Carnarvon, as follows:&mdash;&lsquo;The
old people who would be likely to know anything about <i>Ffynnon
Faglan</i> have all died. The two oldest inhabitants, who have always
lived in this parish of &#7930;anfaglan, remember the well being used
for healing purposes. One told me his mother used to take him to it,
when he was a child, for sore eyes, bathe them with the water, and then
drop in a pin. The other man, when he was young, bathed in it for
rheumatism; and until quite lately people used to fetch away the water
for medicinal purposes. The latter, who lives near the well, at Tan y
Graig, said that he remembered it being cleaned out about fifty years
ago, when two basinfuls of pins were taken out, but no coin of any
kind. The pins were all bent, and I conclude the intention was to
exorcise the evil spirit supposed to afflict the person who dropped
them in, or, as the Welsh say, <i>dadwitsio</i>. No doubt some ominous
words were also used. The well is at present nearly dry, the field
where it lies having been drained some years ago, and the water in
consequence withdrawn from it. It was much used for the cure of warts.
The wart was washed, then pricked with a pin, which, after being bent,
was thrown into the well. There is a very large and well-known well of
the kind at C&rsquo;lynnog, <i>Ffynnon Beuno</i>, &ldquo;St.
Beuno&rsquo;s Well,&rdquo; which was considered to have miraculous
healing powers; and even yet, I believe, some people have faith in it.
<i>Ffynnon Faglan</i> is, in its construction, an imitation, on a
smaller scale, of St. Beuno&rsquo;s Well at C&rsquo;lynnog.&rsquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb364" href="#pb364" name=
"pb364">364</a>]</span></p>
<p>In the cliffs at the west end of &#7930;eyn is a wishing-well called
<i>Ffynnon Fair</i>, or St. Mary&rsquo;s Well, to the left of the site
of Eglwys Fair, and facing Ynys En&#7931;i, or Bardsey. Here, to obtain
your wish, you have to descend the steps to the well and walk up again
to the top with your mouth full of the water; and then you have to go
round the ruins of the church once or more times with the water still
in your mouth. Viewing the position of the well from the sea, I should
be disposed to think that the realization of one&rsquo;s wish at that
price could not be regarded as altogether cheap. Myr&#273;in Far&#273;
also told me that there used to be a well near Criccieth Church. It was
known as <i>Ffynnon y Saint</i>, or the Saints&rsquo; Well, and it was
the custom to throw keys or pins into it on the morning of Easter
Sunday, in order to propitiate St. Catherine, who was the patron of the
well. I should be glad to know what this exactly meant.</p>
<p>Lastly, a few of the wells in that part of Gwyne&#273; may be
grouped together and described as oracular. One of these, the big well
in the parish of &#7930;anbedrog in &#7930;eyn, as I learn from
Myr&#273;in Far&#273;, required the devotee to kneel by it and avow his
faith in it. When this had been duly done, he might proceed in this
wise: to ascertain, for instance, the name of the thief who had stolen
from him, he had to throw a bit of bread into the well and name the
person whom he suspected. At the name of the thief the bread would
sink; so the inquirer went on naming all the persons he could think of
until the bit of bread sank, when the thief was identified. How far is
one to suppose that we have here traces of the influences of the water
ordeal common in the Middle Ages? Another well of the same kind was
<i>Ffynnon Saethon</i>, in &#7930;anfihangel Bache&#7931;aeth parish,
also in &#7930;eyn. Here it was customary, as he had it in writing,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb365" href="#pb365" name=
"pb365">365</a>]</span>for lovers to throw pins (<i>pinnau</i>) into
the well; but these pins appear to have been the points of the
blackthorn. At any rate, they cannot well have been of any kind of
metal, as we are told that, if they sank in the water, one concluded
that one&rsquo;s lover was not sincere in his or her love.</p>
<p>Next may be mentioned a well, bearing the remarkable name of
<i>Ffynnon Gwyne&#273;</i>, or the Well of Gwyned, which is situated
near Myny&#273; Mawr, in the parish of Abererch: it used to be
consulted in the following manner:&mdash;When it was desired to
discover whether an ailing person would recover, a garment of his would
be thrown into the well, and according to the side on which it sank it
was known whether he would live or die.</p>
<p><i>Ffynnon Gybi</i>, or St. Cybi&rsquo;s Well, in the parish of
&#7930;angybi, was the scene of a somewhat similar practice; for there,
girls who wished to know their lovers&rsquo; intentions would spread
their pocket-handkerchiefs on the water of the well, and, if the water
pushed the handkerchiefs to the south&mdash;in Welsh <i>i&rsquo;r
d&ecirc;</i>&mdash;they knew that everything was right&mdash;in Welsh
<i>o &#273;&ecirc;</i>&mdash;and that their lovers were honest and
honourable in their intentions; but, if the water shifted the
handkerchiefs northwards, they concluded the contrary. A reference to
this is made by a modern Welsh poet, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="first">The spot is not far from where Myr&#273;in Far&#273;
lives; and he mentioned, that adjoining the well is a building which
was probably intended for the person in charge <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb366" href="#pb366" name="pb366">366</a>]</span>of
the well: it has been tenanted within his memory. Not only for this but
also for several of the foregoing items of information am I indebted to
Myr&#273;in; and now I come to Mrs. Williams-Ellis, of Glasfryn Uchaf,
who tells me that one day not long ago, she met at &#7930;angybi a
native who had not visited the place since his boyhood: he had been
away as an engineer in South Wales nearly all his life, but had
returned to see an aged relative. So the reminiscences of the place
filled his mind, and, among other things, he said that he remembered
very well what concern there was one day in the village at a
mischievous person having taken a very large eel out of the well. Many
of the old people, he said, felt that much of the virtue of the well
was probably taken away with the eel. To see it coiling about their
limbs when they went into the water was a good sign: so he gave one to
understand. As a sort of parallel I may mention that I have seen the
fish living in <i>Ffynnon Beris</i>, not far from the parish church of
&#7930;anberis. It is jealously guarded by the inhabitants, and when it
was once or twice taken out by a mischievous stranger he was forced to
put it back again. However, I never could get the history of this
sacred fish, but I found that it was regarded as very old<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e14214src" href="#xd25e14214" name=
"xd25e14214src">5</a>. I may add that it appears the well <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb367" href="#pb367" name=
"pb367">367</a>]</span>called <i>Ffynnon Fair</i>, &lsquo;Mary&rsquo;s
Well,&rsquo; at &#7930;an&#273;wyn, in Anglesey, used formerly to have
inhabiting it a sacred fish, whose movements indicated the fortunes of
the love-sick men and maidens who visited there the shrine of St.
Dwynwen<a class="noteref" id="xd25e14253src" href="#xd25e14253" name=
"xd25e14253src">6</a>. Possibly inquiry would result in showing that
such sacred fish have been far more common once in the Principality
than they are now.</p>
<p>The next class of wells to claim our attention consists of what I
may call fairy wells, of which few are mentioned in connexion with
Wales; but the legends about them are of absorbing interest. One of
them is in Myr&#273;in Far&#273;&rsquo;s neighbourhood, and I
questioned him a good deal on the subject: it is called <i>Ffynnon
Grassi</i>, or Grace&rsquo;s Well, and it occupies, according to him, a
few square feet&mdash;he has measured it himself&mdash;of the
south-east corner of the lake of Glasfryn Uchaf, in the parish of
&#7930;angybi. It appears that it was walled in, and that the stone
forming its eastern side has several holes in it, which were intended
to let water enter the well and not issue from it. It had a door or
cover on its surface; and it was necessary to keep the door always
shut, except when water was being drawn. Through somebody&rsquo;s
negligence, however, it was once on a time left open: the consequence
was that the water <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb368" href="#pb368"
name="pb368">368</a>]</span>of the well flowed out and formed the
Glasfryn Lake, which is so considerable as to be navigable for small
boats. Grassi is supposed in the locality to have been the name of the
owner of the well, or at any rate of a lady who had something to do
with it. <i>Grassi</i>, or Grace, however, can only be a name which a
modern version of the legend has introduced. It probably stands for an
older name given to the person in charge of the well; to the one, in
fact, who neglected to shut the door; but though the name must be
comparatively modern, the story, as a whole, does not appear to be at
all modern, but very decidedly the contrary.</p>
<p>So I wrote in 1893; but years after my conversation with Myr&#273;in
Far&#273;, my attention was called to the fact that the Glasfryn
family, of which the Rev. J. C. Williams-Ellis is the head, have in
their coat of arms a mermaid, who is represented in the usual way,
holding a comb in her right hand and a mirror in her left. I had from
the first expected to find some kind of Undine or Liban story
associated with the well and the lake, though I had abstained from
trying the risky effects of leading questions; but when I heard of the
heraldic mermaid I wrote to Mr. Williams-Ellis to ask whether he knew
her history. His words, though not encouraging as regards the mermaid,
soon convinced me that I had not been wholly wrong in supposing that
more folklore attached to the well and lake than I had been able to
discover. Since then Mrs. Williams-Ellis has taken the trouble of
collecting on the spot all the items of tradition which she could find:
she communicated them to me in the month of March, 1899, and the
following is an abstract of them, preceded by a brief description of
the ground:&mdash;</p>
<p>The well itself is at the foot of a very green field-bank at the
head of the lake, but not on the same level <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb369" href="#pb369" name="pb369">369</a>]</span>with
it, as the lake has had its waters lowered half a century or more ago
by the outlet having been cut deeper. Adjoining the field containing
the well is a larger field, which also slopes down to the lake and
extends in another direction to the grounds belonging to the house.
This larger field is called Cae&rsquo;r Ladi, &lsquo;the Lady&rsquo;s
Field,&rsquo; and it is remarkable for having in its centre an ancient
standing stone, which, as seen from the windows of the house, presents
the appearance of a female figure hurrying along, with the wind
slightly swelling out her veil and the skirt of her dress. Mr.
Williams-Ellis remembers how when he was a boy the stone was partially
white-washed, and how an old bonnet adorned the top of this would-be
statue, and he thinks that an old shawl used to be thrown over the
shoulders.</p>
<p>Now as to Grassi, she is mostly regarded as a ghostly person somehow
connected with the lake and the house of Glasfryn. One story is to the
effect, that on a certain evening she forgot to close the well, and
that when the gushing waters had formed the lake, poor Grassi, overcome
with remorse, wandered up and down the high ground of Cae&rsquo;r Ladi,
moaning and weeping. There, in fact, she is still at times to be heard
lamenting her fate, especially at two o&rsquo;clock in the early
morning. Some people say that she is also to be seen about the lake,
which is now the haunt of some half a dozen swans. But on the whole her
visits appear to have been most frequent and troublesome at the house
itself. Several persons still living are mentioned, who believe that
they have seen her there, and two of them, Mrs. Jones of Talafon, and
old Sydney Griffith of Ty&#273;yn Bach, agree in the main in their
description of what they saw, namely, a tall lady with well marked
features and large bright eyes: she was dressed in white silk and a
white velvet bonnet. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb370" href="#pb370"
name="pb370">370</a>]</span>The woman, Sydney Griffith, thought that
she had seen the lady walking several times about the house and in
Cae&rsquo;r Ladi. This comes, in both instances, from a young lady born
and bred in the immediate neighbourhood, and studying now at the
University College of North Wales; but Mrs. Williams-Ellis has had
similar accounts from other sources, and she mentions tenants of
Glasfryn who found it difficult to keep servants there, because they
felt that the place was haunted. In fact one of the tenants himself
felt so unsafe that he used to take his gun and his dog with him to his
bedroom at night; not to mention that when the Williams-Ellises lived
themselves, as they do still, in the house, their visitors have been
known to declare that they heard the strange plaintive cry out of doors
at two o&rsquo;clock in the morning.</p>
<p>Traces also of a very different story are reported by Mrs.
Williams-Ellis, to the effect that when the water broke forth to form
the lake, the fairies seized Grassi and changed her into a swan, and
that she continued in that form to live on the lake sixscore years, and
that when at length she died, she loudly lamented her lot: that cry is
still to be heard at night. This story is in process apparently of
being rationalized; at any rate the young lady student, to whom I have
referred, remembers perfectly that her grandfather used to explain to
her and the other children at home that Grassi was changed into a swan
as a punishment for haunting Glasfryn, but that nevertheless the old
lady still visited the place, especially when there happened to be
strangers in the house. At the end of September last Mrs. Rhys and I
had the pleasure of spending a few days at Glasfryn, in the hope of
hearing the plaintive wail, and of seeing the lady in white silk
revisiting her familiar haunts. But alas! our sleep was never once
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb371" href="#pb371" name=
"pb371">371</a>]</span>disturbed, nor was our peace once troubled by
suspicions of anything uncanny. This, however, is negative, and
characterized by the usual weakness of all such evidence.</p>
<p>It is now time to turn to another order of facts: in the first place
may be mentioned that the young lady student&rsquo;s grandmother used
to call the well <i>Ffynnon Gr&acirc;s Si&ocirc;n Gruffu&#273;</i>, as
she had always heard that Gr&acirc;s was the daughter of a certain
Si&ocirc;n Gruffy&#273;, &lsquo;John Griffith,&rsquo; who lived near
the well; and Mrs. Williams-Ellis finds that Gr&acirc;s was buried, at
a very advanced age, on December 14, 1743, at the parish church of
&#7930;angybi, where the register describes her as <i>Grace Jones,
alias Grace Jones Griffith</i>. She had lived till the end at Glasfryn,
but from documents in the possession of the Glasfryn family it is known
that in 1728 Hugh Lloyd of Tra&#7931;wyn purchased the house and estate
of Glasfryn from a son of Grace&rsquo;s, named <i>John ab
Cadwaladr</i>, and that Hugh Lloyd of Tra&#7931;wyn&rsquo;s son, the
Rev. William Lloyd, sold them to Archdeacon Ellis, from whom they have
descended to the Rev. J. C. Williams-Ellis. In the light of these facts
there is no reason to connect the old lady&rsquo;s name very closely
with the well or the lake. She was once the dominant figure at
Glasfryn, that is all; and when she died she was as usual supposed to
haunt the house and its immediate surroundings; and if we might venture
to suppose that Glasfryn was sold by her son against her will, though
subject to conditions which enabled her to remain in possession of the
place to the day of her death, we should have a further explanation,
perhaps, of her supposed moaning and lamentation.</p>
<p>In the background, however, of the story, one detects the
possibility of another female figure, for it may be that the standing
stone in Cae&rsquo;r Ladi represents a <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb372" href="#pb372" name="pb372">372</a>]</span>woman buried there
centuries before Grace ruled at Glasfryn, and that traditions about the
earlier lady have survived to be inextricably mixed with those
concerning the later one. Lastly, those traditions may have also
associated the subject of them with the well and the lake; but I wish
to attach no importance to this conjecture, as we have in reserve a
third figure of larger possibilities than either Grace or the stone
woman. It needs no better introduction than Mrs. Williams-Ellis&rsquo;
own words: &lsquo;Our younger boys have a crew of three little Welsh
boys who live near the lake, to join them in their boat sailing about
the pool and in camping on the island, &amp;c. They asked me once who
<i>Morgan</i> was, whom the little boys were always saying they were to
be careful against. An old man living at Tal &#7930;yn,
&ldquo;Lake&rsquo;s End,&rdquo; a farm close by, says that as a boy he
was always told that &ldquo;naughty boys would be carried off by Morgan
into the lake.&rdquo; Others tell me that Morgan is always held to be
ready to take off troublesome children, and somehow Morgan is thought
of as a bad one.&rsquo; Now as Morgan carries children off into the
pool, he would seem to issue from the pool, and to have his home in it.
Further, he plays the same part as the fairies against whom a
Snowdonian mother used to warn her children: they were on no account to
wander away from the house when there was a mist, lest the fairies
should carry them to their home beneath &#7930;yn Dwythwch. In other
words, Morgan may be said to act in the same way as the mermaid, who
takes a sailor down to her submarine home; and it explains to my mind a
discussion which I once heard of the name Morgan by a party of men and
women making hay one fine summer&rsquo;s day in the neighbourhood of
Ponterwyd, in North Cardiganshire. I was a child, but I remember
vividly how they teased one of their number whose <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb373" href="#pb373" name=
"pb373">373</a>]</span>&lsquo;style&rsquo; was Morgan. They hinted at
dreadful things associated with the name; but it was all so vague that
I could not gather that his great unknown namesake was a thief, a
murderer, or any kind of ordinary criminal. The impression left on my
mind was rather the notion of something weird, uncanny, or non-human;
and the fact that the Welsh version of the Book of Common Prayer calls
the Pelagians <i>Morganiaid</i>, &lsquo;Morgans,&rsquo; does not offer
an adequate explanation. But I now see clearly that it is to be sought
in the indistinct echo of such folklore as that which makes Morgan a
terror to children in the neighbourhood of the Glasfryn Lake.</p>
<p>The name, however, presents points of difficulty which require some
notice: the Welsh translators of Article IX in the Prayer Book were
probably wrong in making <i>Pelagians</i> into <i>Morganiaid</i>, as
the Welsh for <i>Pelagius</i> seems to have been rather
<i>Morien</i><a class="noteref" id="xd25e14322src" href="#xd25e14322"
name="xd25e14322src">7</a>, which in its oldest recorded form was
<i>Morgen</i>, and meant sea-born, or offspring of the sea. In a still
earlier form it must have been <i>Morigenos</i>, with a feminine
<i>Morigena</i>, but when the endings came to be dropped both vocables
would become <i>Morgen</i>, later <i>Mori&#815;en</i>. I do not
remember coming across a feminine <i>Morgen</i> in Welsh, but the
presumption is that it did exist. For, among other things, I may
mention that we have it in Irish as <i>Muirgen</i>, one of the names of
the lake lady Liban, who, when the waters of the neglected well rushed
forth to form Lough Neagh, lived beneath that lake until she desired to
be changed into a salmon. The same conclusion may be drawn from the
name <i>Morgain</i> or <i>Morgan</i>, given in the French romances to
one or more water ladies; for those names are easiest to explain as the
Brythonic <i>Morgen</i> borrowed from a Welsh or Breton source, unless
one found it possible to trace it direct to the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb374" href="#pb374" name=
"pb374">374</a>]</span>Goidels of Wales. No sooner, however, had the
confusion taken place between Morgen and the name which is so common in
Wales as exclusively a man&rsquo;s name, than the aquatic figure must
also become male. That is why the Glasfryn Morgan is now a male, and
not a female like the other characters whose r&ocirc;le he plays. But
while the name was in Welsh successively <i>Morgen</i> and
<i>Morien</i>, the man&rsquo;s name was <i>Morcant</i>, <i>Morgant</i>,
or <i>Morgan</i><a class="noteref" id="xd25e14382src" href=
"#xd25e14382" name="xd25e14382src">8</a>, so that, phonologically
speaking, no confusion could be regarded as possible between the two
series. Here, therefore, one detects the influence, doubtless, of the
French romances which spoke of a lake lady Morgain, Morgan, or Morgue.
The character varied: Morgain le Fay was a designing and wicked person;
but Morgan was also the name of a well disposed lady of the same fairy
kind, who took Arthur away to be healed at her home in the Isle of
Avallon. We seem to be on the track of the same confusing influence of
the name, when it occurs in the story of Geraint and Enid; for there
the chief physician of Arthur&rsquo;s court is called Morgan Tut or
Morgant Tut, and the word <i>tut</i> has been shown by M. Loth to have
meant the same sort of non-human being whom an eleventh-century Life of
St. Maudez mentions as <i>quidam d&aelig;mon quem Britones</i> Tuthe
<i>appellant</i>. Thus the name <i>Morgan Tut</i> <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb375" href="#pb375" name="pb375">375</a>]</span>is
meant as the Welsh equivalent of the French <i lang="fr">Morgain le
Fay</i> or <i lang="fr">Morgan la F&eacute;e</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e14455src" href="#xd25e14455" name="xd25e14455src">9</a>; but so
long as the compiler of the story of Geraint and Enid employed in his
Welsh the form Morgan, he had practically no choice but to treat the
person called Morgan as a man, whether that was or was not the sex in
the original texts on which he was drawing. Of course he could have
avoided the difficulty in case he was aware of it, if he had found some
available formula in use like <i>Mary-Morgant</i>, said to be a common
name for a fairy on the island of Ouessant, off the coast of
Brittany.</p>
<p>Summarizing the foregoing notes, we seem to be right in drawing the
following conclusions:&mdash;(1) The well was left in the charge of a
woman who forgot to shut it, and when she saw the water bursting forth,
she bewailed her negligence, as in the case of her counterpart in the
legend of Cantre&rsquo;r Gwaelod. (2) The original name of the Glasfryn
&lsquo;Morgan&rsquo; was Morgen, later Morien. (3) The person changed
into a swan on the occasion of the Glasfryn well erupting was not
Grassi, but most probably Morgen. And (4) the character was originally
feminine, like that of the mermaid or the fairies, whose r&ocirc;le the
Glasfryn Morgan plays; and more especially may one compare the Irish
Muirgen, the <i>Morgen</i> more usually called L&iacute;ban. For it is
to be noticed that when the neglected well burst forth she, Muirgen or
L&iacute;ban, was not drowned like the others <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb376" href="#pb376" name=
"pb376">376</a>]</span>involved in the calamity, but lived in her
chamber at the bottom of the lake formed by the overflowing well, until
she was changed into a salmon. In that form she lived on some three
centuries, until in fact she was caught in the net of a fisherman, and
obtained the boon of a Christian burial. However, the change into a
swan is also known on Irish ground: take for instance the story of the
Children of Lir, who were converted into swans by their stepmother, and
lived in that form on Loch Dairbhreach, in Westmeath, for three hundred
years, and twice as long on the open sea, until their destiny closed
with the advent of St. Patrick and the first ringing of a Christian
bell in Erin<a class="noteref" id="xd25e14510src" href="#xd25e14510"
name="xd25e14510src">10</a>.</p>
<p>The next legend was kindly communicated to me by Mr. Wm. Davies
already mentioned at p. 147 above: he found it in <i>Cyfai&#7931; yr
Aelwyd</i><a class="noteref" id="xd25e14520src" href="#xd25e14520"
name="xd25e14520src">11</a>, &ldquo;The Friend of the Hearth,&rdquo;
where it is stated that it belonged to David Jones&rsquo; <i>Storehouse
of Curiosities</i>, a collection which does not seem to have ever
assumed the form of a printed book. David Jones, of Trefriw, in the
Conwy Valley, was a publisher and poet who wrote between 1750 and 1780.
This is his story: &lsquo;In 1735 I had a conversation with a man
concerning Tegid Lake. He had heard from old people that near the
middle of it there was a well opposite &#7930;angower, and the well was
called <i>Ffynnon Gywer</i>, &ldquo;Cower&rsquo;s Well,&rdquo; and at
that time the town was round about the well. It was obligatory to place
a lid on the well every night. (It seems that in those days somebody
was aware that unless this was done it would prove the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb377" href="#pb377" name=
"pb377">377</a>]</span>destruction of the town.) But one night it was
forgotten, and by the morning, behold the town had subsided and the
lake became three miles long and one mile wide. They say, moreover,
that on clear days some people see the chimneys of the houses. It is
since then that the town was built at <i>the lower end of the lake</i>.
It is called <i>Y Bala</i><a class="noteref" id="xd25e14543src" href=
"#xd25e14543" name="xd25e14543src">12</a>, and the man told me that he
had talked with an old Bala man who had, when he was a youth, had two
days&rsquo; mowing of hay<a class="noteref" id="xd25e14618src" href=
"#xd25e14618" name="xd25e14618src">13</a> between the road and the
lake; but by this time the lake had spread over that land and the road
also, which necessitated the purchase of land further away for the
road; and some say that the town will yet sink as far as the place
called &#7930;anfor&mdash;others call it &#7930;anfaw&#273;,
&ldquo;Drown-church,&rdquo; or &#7930;anfawr,
&ldquo;Great-church,&rdquo; in Pen&#7931;yn&#8202;&hellip;. Further,
when the weather is stormy water appears oozing through every floor
within Bala, and at other times anybody can get water enough for the
use of his house, provided he dig a little into the floor of
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In reference to the idea that the town is to sink, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb378" href="#pb378" name=
"pb378">378</a>]</span>together with the neighbouring village of
&#7930;anfor, the writer quotes in a note the couplet known still to
everybody in the neighbourhood as follows:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div lang="cy" class="lg">
<p class="line"><i>Y Bala aeth, a&rsquo;r Bala aiff,</i></p>
<p class="line"><i>A &#7930;anfor aiff yn &#7930;yn.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Bala old the lake has had, and Bala new</p>
<p class="line">The lake will have, and &#7930;anfor too.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">This probably implies that old Bala is beneath the
lake, and that the present Bala is to meet the like fate at some time
to come. This kind of prophecy is not very uncommon: thus there has
been one current as to the Montgomeryshire town of Pool, called, in
Welsh, Tra&#7931;wng or Tra&#7931;wm, and in English, Welshpool, to
distinguish it from the English town of Pool. As to Welshpool, a very
deep water called &#7930;yn Du, lying between the town and the
<i>Caste&#7931; Coch</i> or Powys Castle, and right in the domain of
the castle, is suddenly to spread itself, and one fine market day to
engulf the whole place<a class="noteref" id="xd25e14664src" href=
"#xd25e14664" name="xd25e14664src">14</a>. Further, when I was a boy in
North Cardiganshire, the following couplet was quite familiar to me,
and supposed to have been one of Merlin&rsquo;s prophecies:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div lang="cy" class="lg">
<p class="line"><i>Caer Fyr&#273;in, cei oer fore;</i></p>
<p class="line"><i>Daear a&rsquo;th lwnc, dw&rsquo;r i&rsquo;th
le.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Carmarthen, a cold morn awaits thee;</p>
<p class="line">Earth gapes, and water in thy place will be.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">In regard to the earlier half of the line, concerning
Bala gone, the story of Ffynnon Gywer might be said to explain it, but
there is another which is later and far better known. It is of the same
kind as the stories <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb379" href="#pb379"
name="pb379">379</a>]</span>related in Welsh concerning &#7930;ynclys
and Syfa&#273;on; but I reserve it with these and others of the same
sort for chapter vii.</p>
<p>For the next legend belonging here I have to thank the Rev. J.
Fisher, a native of the parish of &#7930;andyb&iuml;e, who, in spite of
his name, is a genuine Welshman, and&mdash;what is more&mdash;a Welsh
scholar. The following are his words:&mdash;&lsquo;&#7930;yn &#7930;ech
Owen (the last word is locally sounded <i>w-en</i>, like <i>oo-en</i>
in English, as is also the personal name Owen) is on Myny&#273; Mawr,
in the ecclesiastical parish of Gors L&acirc;s, and the civil parish of
&#7930;anarthney, Carmarthenshire. It is a small lake, forming the
source of the Gwendraeth Fawr. I have heard the tradition about its
origin told by several persons, and by all, until quite recently,
pretty much in the same form. In 1884 I took it down from my
grandfather, Rees Thomas (<i>b.</i> 1809, <i>d.</i> 1892), of Cil
Co&#7931; &#7930;andeb&iuml;e&mdash;a very intelligent man, with a good
fund of old-world Welsh lore&mdash;who had lived all his life in the
neighbouring parishes of &#7930;andeilo Fawr and
&#7930;andyb&iuml;e.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The following is the version of the story (translated) as I
had it from him:&mdash;There was once a man of the name of Owen living
on Myny&#273; Mawr, and he had a well, &ldquo;<i lang=
"cy">ffynnon</i>.&rdquo; Over this well he kept a large flag
(&ldquo;<i lang="cy">fflagen neu lech fawr</i>&rdquo;: &ldquo;<i lang=
"cy">fflagen</i>&rdquo; is the word in common use now in these parts
for a large flat stone), which he was always careful to replace over
its mouth after he had satisfied himself or his beast with water. It
happened, however, that one day he went on horseback to the well to
water his horse, and forgot to put the flag back in its place. He rode
off leisurely in the direction of his home; but, after he had gone some
distance, he casually looked back, and, to his great astonishment, he
saw that the well had burst out and was overflowing the whole place. He
suddenly bethought him that he should ride <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb380" href="#pb380" name="pb380">380</a>]</span>back
and encompass the overflow of the water as fast as he could; and it was
the horse&rsquo;s track in galloping round the water that put a stop to
its further overflow. It is fully believed that, had he not galloped
round the flood in the way he did, the well would have been sure to
inundate the whole district and drown all. Hence the lake was called
the Lake of Owen&rsquo;s Flag, &ldquo;<i lang="cy">&#7930;yn &#7930;ech
Owen</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have always felt interested in this story, as it resembled
that about the formation of Lough Neagh, &amp;c.; and, happening to
meet the Rev. D. Harwood Hughes, B.A., the vicar of Gors L&acirc;s (St.
&#7930;eian&rsquo;s), last August (1892), I asked him to tell me the
legend as he had heard it in his parish. He said that he had been told
it, but in a form different from mine, where the &ldquo;Owen&rdquo; was
said to have been Owen Glyndwr. This is the substance of the legend as
he had heard it:&mdash;Owen Glyndwr, when once passing through these
parts, arrived here of an evening. He came across a well, and, having
watered his horse, placed a stone over it in order to find it again
next morning. He then went to lodge for the night at Dy&#7931;goed
Farm, close by. In the morning, before proceeding on his journey, he
took his horse to the well to give him water, but found to his surprise
that the well had become a lake.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Fisher goes on to mention the later history of the lake: how,
some eighty years ago, its banks were the resort on Sunday afternoons
of the young people of the neighbourhood, and how a Baptist preacher
put an end to their amusements and various kinds of games by preaching
at them. However, the lake-side appears to be still a favourite spot
for picnics and Sunday-school gatherings. Mr. Fisher was quite right in
appending to his own version that of his friend; but, from the point of
view of folklore, I must confess that I can make <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb381" href="#pb381" name=
"pb381">381</a>]</span>nothing of the latter: it differs from the older
one as much as chalk does from cheese. It would be naturally gratifying
to the pride of local topography to be able to connect with the pool
the name of Owen Glyndwr; but it is worthy of note that this highly
respectable attempt to rationalize the legend wholly fails, as it does
not explain why there is now a lake where there was once but a well. In
other words, the euhemerized story is itself evidence corroborative of
Mr. Fisher&rsquo;s older version, which is furthermore kept in
countenance by Howells&rsquo; account, p. 104, where we are told who
the Owen in question was, namely, Owen Lawgoch, a personage dear, as we
shall see later, to the Welsh legend of the district. He and his men
had their abode in a cave on the northern side of Myny&#273; Mawr, and
while there Owen used, we are informed, to water his steed at a fine
spring covered with a large stone, which it required the strength of a
giant to lift. But one day he forgot to replace it, and when he next
sought the well he found the lake. He returned to his cave and told his
men what had happened. Thereupon both he and they fell into a sleep,
which is to last till it is broken by the sound of a trumpet and the
clang of arms on Rhiw Goch: then they are to sally forth to
conquer.</p>
<p>Now the story as told by Howells and Fisher provokes comparison, as
the latter suggests, with the Irish legend of the formation of Lough
Ree and of Lough Neagh in the story of the Death of Eochaid
McMaireda<a class="noteref" id="xd25e14753src" href="#xd25e14753" name=
"xd25e14753src">15</a>. In both <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb382"
href="#pb382" name="pb382">382</a>]</span>of these legends also there
is a horse, a kind of water-horse, who forms the well which eventually
overflows and becomes Lough Ree, and so with the still larger body of
water known as Lough Neagh. In the latter case the fairy well was
placed in the charge of a woman; but she one day left the cover of the
well open, and the catastrophe took place&mdash;the water issued forth
and overflowed the country. One of Eochaid&rsquo;s daughters, named
L&iacute;ban, however, was not drowned, but only changed into a salmon
as already mentioned at p. 376 above. In my <i>Arthurian Legend</i>, p.
361, I have attempted to show that the name <i>L&iacute;ban</i> may
have its Welsh equivalent in that of <i>&#7930;&iuml;on</i>, occurring
in the name of <i>&#7930;yn &#7930;&iuml;on</i>, or
&#7930;&iuml;on&rsquo;s Lake, the bursting of which is described in the
latest series of Triads, iii. 13, 97, as causing a sort of deluge. I am
not certain as to the nature of the relationship between those names,
but it seems evident that the stories have a common substratum, though
it is to be noticed that no well, fairy or otherwise, figures in the
&#7930;yn &#7930;&iuml;on legend, which makes the presence of the
monster called the afanc the cause of the waters bursting forth. So Hu
the Mighty, with his team of famous oxen, is made to drag the afanc out
of the lake.</p>
<p>There is, however, another Welsh legend concerning a great overflow
in which a well does figure: I allude to that of <i>Cantre&rsquo;r
Gwaelod</i>, or the Bottom Hundred, a fine spacious country supposed to
be submerged in Cardigan Bay. Modern euhemerism treats it as defended
by embankments and sluices, which, we are told, were in the charge of
the prince of the country, named Seithennin, who, being one day in his
cups, forgot to shut the sluices, and thus brought about the
inundation, which was the end of his fertile realm. This, however, is
not the old legend: that speaks of a well, and lays the blame on a
woman&mdash;a pretty sure sign of antiquity, as <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb383" href="#pb383" name="pb383">383</a>]</span>the
reader may judge from other old stories which will readily occur to
him. The Welsh legend to which I allude is embodied in a short poem in
the <i>Black Book of Carmarthen</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e14808src" href="#xd25e14808" name="xd25e14808src">16</a>: it
consists of eight triplets, to which is added a triplet from the
Englynion of the Graves. The following is the original with a tentative

<p class="first">The names in these lines present great difficulties:
first comes that of <i>Mererid</i>, which is no other word than
<i>Margarita</i>, &lsquo;a pearl,&rsquo; borrowed; but what does it
here mean? <i>Margarita</i>, besides meaning a pearl, was used in
Welsh, e.g. under the form <i>Marereda</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd25e15084src" href="#xd25e15084" name="xd25e15084src">18</a>, as the
proper name written in English <i>Margaret</i>. That is probably how it
is to be taken here, namely, as the name given to the negligent
guardian of the fairy well. It cannot very well be, however, the name
belonging to the original form of the legend; and we have the somewhat
parallel case of <i>Ffynnon Grassi</i>, or Grace&rsquo;s Well; but what
old Celtic name that of Mererid has replaced in the story, I cannot
say. In the next place, nobody has been able to identify <i>Caer
Kenedyr</i>, and I have nothing to say as to <i>Mor Maurhidic</i>,
except that a person of that name is mentioned in another of the
Englynion of the Graves. It runs thus in the <i>Black Book</i>, fol.
33<sup>a</sup>:&mdash;</p>

</div>
<p class="first">The last name in the final triplet of the poem which I
have attempted to translate is <i>Kinran</i>, which is otherwise
unknown as a Welsh name; but I am inclined to identify it with that of
one of the three who escaped the catastrophe in the Irish legend. The
name there is <i>Curn&aacute;n</i>, which was borne by the idiot of the
family, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb385" href="#pb385" name=
"pb385">385</a>]</span>who, like many later idiots, was at the same
time a prophet. For he is represented as always prophesying that the
waters were going to burst forth, and as advising his friends to
prepare boats. So he may be set, after a fashion, over against our
<i>Seithenhin synhuir vann</i>, &lsquo;S. of the feeble mind.&rsquo;
But one might perhaps ask why I do not point out an equivalent in Irish
for the Welsh Seithennin, as his name is now pronounced. The fact is
that no such equivalent occurs in the Irish story in question, nor
exactly, so far as I know, in any other.</p>
<p>That is what I wrote when penning these notes; but it has occurred
to me since then, that there is an Irish name, an important Irish name,
which looks as if related to <i>Seithenhin</i>, and that is <i>Setanta
Beg</i>, &lsquo;the little Setantian,&rsquo; the first name of the
Irish hero C&uacute;chulainn. The <i>nt</i>, I may point out, makes one
suspect that <i>Setanta</i> is a name of Brythonic origin in Irish; and
I have been in the habit of associating it with that of the people of
the Setantii<a class="noteref" id="xd25e15157src" href="#xd25e15157"
name="xd25e15157src">19</a>, placed by Ptolemy on the coast of what is
now Lancashire. Whether any legend has ever been current about a
country submerged on the coast of Lancashire I cannot say, but the
soundings would make such a legend quite comprehensible. I remember,
however, reading somewhere as to the Plain of Muirthemhne, of which
C&uacute;chulainn, our Setanta Beg, had special charge, that it was so
called because it had once been submarine and become since the
converse, so to say, of Seithennin&rsquo;s country. The latter is
beneath Cardigan Bay, while the other fringed the opposite side of the
sea, consisting as it did of the level portion of County Louth. On the
whole, I am not altogether indisposed to believe that we have here
traces of an ancient legend <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb386" href=
"#pb386" name="pb386">386</a>]</span>of a wider scope than is
represented by the <i>Black Book</i> triplets, which I have essayed to
translate. I think that I am right in recognizing that legend in the
<i>Mabinogi</i> of Branwen, daughter of &#7930;yr. There we read that,
when Br&acirc;n and his men crossed from Wales to Ireland, the
intervening sea consisted merely of two navigable rivers, called
&#7930;i and Archan. The story-teller adds words to the effect, that it
is only since then the sea has multiplied its realms<a class="noteref"
id="xd25e15172src" href="#xd25e15172" name="xd25e15172src">20</a>
between Ireland and <i>Ynys y Kedyrn</i>, or the Isle of the Keiri, a
name which has already been discussed: see pp. 279&ndash;83.</p>
<p>These are not all the questions which such stories suggest; for
Seithennin is represented in later Welsh literature as the son of one
<i>Seithyn</i>, associated with Dyfed; and the name <i>Seithyn</i>
leads off to the coast of Brittany. For I learn from a paper by the
late M. le Men, in the <i lang="fr">Revue Arch&eacute;ologique</i> for
1872 (xxiii. 52), that the &Icirc;le de Sein is called in Breton
<i>Enez-Sun</i>, in which <i>Sun</i> is a dialectic shortening of
<i>Sizun</i>, which is also met with as <i>Seidhun</i>. That being so,
one would seem to be right in regarding Sizun as nearly related to our
<i>Seithyn</i>. That is not all&mdash;the tradition reminds one of the
Welsh legend: M. le Men refers to the <i>Vie du P. Maunoir</i> by
Boschet (Paris, 1697) p. 126, and adds that, in his own time, the road
ending on the Pointe du Raz opposite the &Icirc;le de Sein passed
&lsquo;<span lang="fr">pour &ecirc;tre l&rsquo;ancien chemin qui
conduisait &agrave; la ville d&rsquo;Is (<i>Kaer-a-Is</i>, la ville de
la partie basse)</span>.&rsquo; It is my own experience, that nobody
can go about much in Brittany without hearing over and over again about
the submerged city of Is. There is no doubt that we have in these names
distant echoes of an inundation story, once widely current in both
Britains and perhaps also in Ireland. With regard to Wales we have an
indication <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb387" href="#pb387" name=
"pb387">387</a>]</span>to that effect in the fact, that Gwy&#273;no, to
whom the inundated region is treated as having belonged, is associated
not only with Cardigan Bay, but also with the coast of North Wales,
especially the part of it situated between Bangor and
&#7930;andudno<a class="noteref" id="xd25e15223src" href="#xd25e15223"
name="xd25e15223src">21</a>. Adjoining it is supposed to lie submerged
a once fertile district called Tyno Helig, a legend about which will
come under notice later. This brings the inundation story nearer to the
coast where Ptolemy in the second century located the Harbour of the
Setantii, about the mouth of the river Ribble, and in their name we
seem to have some sort of a historical basis for that of the drunken
Seithennin<a class="noteref" id="xd25e15229src" href="#xd25e15229"
name="xd25e15229src">22</a>. I cannot close these remarks better than
by <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb388" href="#pb388" name=
"pb388">388</a>]</span>appending what Professor Boyd Dawkins has
recently said with regard to the sea between Britain and
Ireland:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It may be interesting to remark further that during the time
of the Iberian dominion in Wales, the geography of the seaboard was
different to what it is now. A forest, containing the remains of their
domestic oxen that had run wild, and of the indigenous wild animals
such as the bear and the red deer, united Anglesey with the mainland,
and occupied the shallows of Cardigan Bay, known in legend as
&ldquo;the lost lands of Wales.&rdquo; It extended southwards from the
present sea margin across the estuary of the Severn, to Somerset,
Devon, and Cornwall. It passed northwards across the Irish Sea off the
coast of Cheshire and Lancashire, and occupied Morecambe Bay with a
dense growth of oak, Scotch fir, alder, birch, and hazel. It ranged
seawards beyond the ten-fathom line, and is to be found on most
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb389" href="#pb389" name=
"pb389">389</a>]</span>shores beneath the sand-banks and mud-banks, as
for example at Rhyl and Cardiff. In Cardigan Bay it excited the wonder
of Giraldus de Barri<a class="noteref" id="xd25e15418src" href=
"#xd25e15418" name="xd25e15418src">23</a>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>To return to fairy wells, I have to confess that I cannot decide
what may be precisely the meaning of the notion of a well with a woman
set carefully to see that the door or cover of the well is kept shut.
It will occur, however, to everybody to compare the well which Undine
wished to have kept shut, on account of its affording a ready access
from her subterranean country to the residence of her refractory knight
in his castle above ground. And in the case of the Glasfryn Lake, the
walling and cover that were to keep the spring from overflowing were,
according to the story, not water-tight, seeing that there were holes
made in one of the stones. This suggests the idea that the cover was to
prevent the passage of some such full-grown fairies as those with which
legend seems to have once peopled all the pools and tarns of Wales.
But, in the next place, is the maiden in charge of the well to be
regarded as priestess of the well? The idea of a priesthood in
connexion with wells in Wales is not wholly unknown.</p>
<p>I wish, however, before discussing these instances, to call
attention to one or two Irish ones which point in another direction.
Foremost may be mentioned the source of the river Boyne, which is now
called Trinity Well, situated in the Barony of Carbury, in County
Kildare. The following is the Rennes <i>Dindsenchas</i> concerning it,
as translated by Dr. Stokes, in the <i>Revue Celtique</i>, xv.
315&ndash;6:&mdash;&lsquo;B&oacute;and, wife of Necht&aacute;n son of
Labraid, went to the secret well which was in the green of S&iacute;d
Necht&aacute;in. Whoever went to it would not come <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb390" href="#pb390" name="pb390">390</a>]</span>from
it without his two eyes bursting, unless it were Necht&aacute;n himself
and his three cup-bearers, whose names were Flesc and L&aacute;m and
Luam. Once upon a time B&oacute;and went through pride to test the
well&rsquo;s power, and declared that it had no secret force which
could shatter her form, and thrice she walked withershins round the
well. (Whereupon) three waves from the well break over her and deprive
her of a thigh [? <i>wounded her thigh</i>] and one of her hands and
one of her eyes. Then she, fleeing her shame, turns seaward, with the
water behind her as far as Boyne-mouth, (where she was drowned).&rsquo;
This is to explain why the river is called <i>B&oacute;and</i>,
&lsquo;Boyne.&rsquo; A version to the same effect in the <i>Book of
Leinster</i>, fol. 191<sup>a</sup>, makes the general statement that no
one who gazed right into the well could avoid the instant ruin of his
two eyes or otherwise escape with impunity. A similar story is related
to show how the Shannon, in Irish <i>Sinann</i>, <i>Sinand</i>, or
<i>Sinend</i>, is called after a woman of that name. It occurs in the
same Rennes manuscript, and the following is Stokes&rsquo; translation
in the <i>Revue Celtique</i>, xv. 457:&mdash;&lsquo;Sinend, daughter of
Lodan Lucharglan son of Ler out of Tir Tairngire (Land of Promise,
Fairyland), went to Connla&rsquo;s Well, which is under sea, to behold
it. That is a well at which are the hazels and inspirations (?) of
wisdom, that is, the hazels of the science of poetry, and in the same
hour their fruit and their blossom and their foliage break forth, and
these fall on the well in the same shower, which raises on the water a
royal surge of purple. Then the salmon chew the fruit, and the juice of
the nuts is apparent on their purple bellies. And seven streams of
wisdom spring forth and turn there again. Now Sinend went to seek the
inspiration, for she wanted nothing save only wisdom. She went with the
stream till she reached <i>Linn Mna Feile</i>, &ldquo;the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb391" href="#pb391" name="pb391">391</a>]</span>Pool
of the Modest Woman,&rdquo; that is Bri Ele&mdash;and she went ahead on
her journey; but the well left its place, and she followed it<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e15474src" href="#xd25e15474" name=
"xd25e15474src">24</a> to the banks of the river
<i>Tarr-c&aacute;in</i>, &ldquo;Fair-back.&rdquo; After this it
overwhelmed her, so that her back (<i>tarr</i>) went upwards, and when
she had come to the land on this side (of the Shannon) she tasted
death. Whence <i>Sinann</i> and <i>Linn Mna Feile</i> and
<i>Tarr-cain</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In these stories the reader will have noticed that the foremost
punishment on any intruder who looked into the forbidden well was the
instant ruin of his two eyes. One naturally asks why the eyes are made
the special objects of the punishment, and I am inclined to think the
meaning to have originally been that the well or spring was regarded as
the eye of the divinity of the water. Should this prove well founded it
looks natural that the eyes, which transgressed by gazing into the eye
of the divinity, should be the first objects of that divinity&rsquo;s
vengeance. This is suggested to me by the fact that the regular Welsh
word for the source of a river is <i>&#7931;ygad</i>, Old Welsh
<i>licat</i>, &lsquo;eye,&rsquo; as for instance in the case of
<i>Licat Amir</i> mentioned by Nennius, &sect; 73; of <i>&#7930;ygad
&#7930;ychwr</i>, &lsquo;the source of the Loughor river&rsquo; in the
hills behind Carreg Cennen Castle; and of the weird lake in which the
Rheidol<a class="noteref" id="xd25e15507src" href="#xd25e15507" name=
"xd25e15507src">25</a> rises near the top of Plinlimmon: it is called
<i>&#7930;yn &#7930;ygad y Rheidol</i>, &lsquo;the Lake of the
Rheidol&rsquo;s Eye.&rsquo; By the way, the Rheidol is not wholly
without its folklore, for I used to be told in my childhood, that she
and the Wye and the Severn sallied forth simultaneously from Plinlimmon
one fine morning <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb392" href="#pb392"
name="pb392">392</a>]</span>to run a race to the sea. The result was,
one was told, that the Rheidol won great honour by reaching the sea
three weeks before her bigger sisters. Somebody has alluded to the
legend in the following lines:&mdash;</p>

<p class="line">Severn, and Wye of pleasant mien,</p>
<p class="line">And Rheidol rich in great renown.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">To return to the Irish legends, I may mention that
Eugene O&rsquo;Curry has a good deal to say of the mysterious nuts and
&lsquo;the salmon of knowledge,&rsquo; the partaking of which was
synonymous with the acquisition of knowledge and wisdom: see his
<i>Manners and Customs of the Ancient Irish</i>, ii. 142&ndash;4. He
gives it as his opinion that Connla&rsquo;s Well was situated somewhere
in Lower Ormond; but the locality of this Helicon, with the seven
streams of wisdom circulating out of it and back again into it, is more
intelligible when regarded as a matter of fairy geography. A portion of
the note appended to the foregoing legend by Stokes is in point here:
he traces the earliest mention of the nine hazels of wisdom, growing at
the heads of the chief rivers of Ireland, to the Dialogue of the Two
Sages in the <i>Book of Leinster</i>, fol. 186<sup>b</sup>, whence he
cites the poet N&eacute;de mac Adnai saying whence he had come, as
follows:&mdash;<i>a caillib .i. a n&oacute;i collaib na Segsa &hellip;
a caillib didiu assa mbenaiter clessa na s&uacute;ad tanacsa</i>,
&lsquo;from hazels, to wit, from the nine hazels of the Segais &hellip;
from hazels out of which are obtained the feats of the sages, I have
come.&rsquo; The relevancy of this passage will be seen when I add,
that Segais was one of the names of the mound in which the Boyne rises;
so it may be safely inferred that B&oacute;and&rsquo;s transgression
was of the same nature as that of Sinand, to wit, that of intruding on
sacred ground in quest of wisdom and inspiration which <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb393" href="#pb393" name="pb393">393</a>]</span>was
not permitted their sex: certain sources of knowledge, certain
<i>quellen</i>, were reserved for men alone.</p>
<p>Before I have done with the Irish instances I must append one in the
form it was told me in the summer of 1894: I was in Meath and went to
see the remarkable chambered cairns on the hill known as <i>Sliabh na
Caillighe</i>, &lsquo;the Hag&rsquo;s Mountain,&rsquo; near Oldcastle
and Lough Crew. I had as my guide a young shepherd whom I picked up on
the way. He knew all about the hag after whom the hill was called
except her name: she was, he said, a giantess, and so she brought
there, in three apronfuls, the stones forming the three principal
cairns. As to the cairn on the hill point known as Belrath, that is
called the Chair Cairn from a big stone placed there by the hag to
serve as her seat when she wished to have a quiet look on the country
round. But usually she was to be seen riding on a wonderful pony she
had: that creature was so nimble and strong that it used to take the
hag at a leap from one hill-top to another. However, the end of it all
was that the hag rode so hard that the pony fell down, and that both
horse and rider were killed. The hag appears to have been <i>Cailleach
Bh&eacute;ara</i>, or <i>Caillech B&eacute;rre</i>, &lsquo;the Old
Woman of Beare,&rsquo; that is, Bearhaven, in County Cork<a class=
"noteref" id="xd25e15577src" href="#xd25e15577" name=
"xd25e15577src">26</a>. Now the view <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb394" href="#pb394" name="pb394">394</a>]</span>from the Hag&rsquo;s
Mountain is very extensive, and I asked the shepherd to point out some
places in the distance. Among other things we could see Lough Ramor,
which he called the Virginia Water, and more to the west he identified
Lough Sheelin, about which he had the following legend to tell:&mdash;A
long, long time ago there was no lake there, but only a well with a
flagstone kept over it, and everybody would put the flag back after
taking water out of the well. But one day a woman who fetched water
from it forgot to replace the stone, and the water burst forth in
pursuit of the luckless woman, who fled as hard as she could before the
angry flood. She continued until she had run about seven
miles&mdash;the estimated length of the lake at the present day. Now at
this point a man, who was busily mowing hay in the field through which
she was running, saw what was happening and mowed the woman down with
his scythe, whereupon the water advanced no further. Such was the
shepherd&rsquo;s yarn, which partly agrees with the Boyne and Shannon
stories in that the woman was pursued by the water, which only stopped
where she died. On the other hand, it resembles the &#7930;yn
&#7930;ech Owen legend and that of Lough Neagh in placing to the
woman&rsquo;s charge only the neglect to cover the well. It looks as if
we had in these stories a confusion of two different institutions, one
being a well of wisdom which no woman durst visit without fatal
vengeance overtaking her, and the other a fairy well which was attended
to by a woman who was to keep it covered, and who may, perhaps, be
regarded as priestess of the spring. If we try to interpret the
Cantre&rsquo;r Gwaelod story from these two points of view we have to
note the following matters:&mdash;Though it is not said that the
<i>moruin</i>, or damsel, had a lid or cover on the well, the word
<i>golligaut</i> or <i>helligaut</i>, &lsquo;did let run,&rsquo;
implies some such an idea <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb395" href=
"#pb395" name="pb395">395</a>]</span>as that of a lid or door; for
opening the sluices, in the sense of the later version, seems to me out
of the question. In two of the Englynion she is cursed for the action
implied, and if she was the well minister or well servant, as I take
<i>finaun wenestir</i> to mean, we might perhaps regard her as the
priestess of that spring. On the other hand, the prevailing note in the
other Englynion is the <i>traha</i>, &lsquo;presumption, arrogance,
insolence, pride,&rsquo; which forms the burden of four out of five of
them. This would seem to point to an attitude on the part of the damsel
resembling that of B&oacute;and or Sinand when prying into the secrets
of wells which were tabu to them. The seventh Englyn alludes to wines,
and its burden is <i>gormo&#273;</i>, &lsquo;too much, excess,
extravagance,&rsquo; whereby the poet seems to lend countenance to some
such a later story as that of Seithennin&rsquo;s intemperance.</p>
<p>Lastly, the question of priest or priestess of a sacred well has
been alluded to once or twice, and it may be perhaps illustrated on
Welsh ground by the history of Ffynnon Eilian, or St. Elian&rsquo;s
Well, which has been mentioned in another context, p. 357 above. Of
that well we read as follows, s. v. <i>&#7930;andri&#7931;o</i>, in the
third edition of Lewis&rsquo; <i>Topographical Dictionary of
Wales</i>:&mdash;&lsquo;Fynnon Elian, &hellip; even in the present age,
is frequently visited by the superstitious, for the purpose of invoking
curses upon the heads of those who have grievously offended them, and
also of supplicating prosperity to themselves; but the numbers are
evidently decreasing. The ceremony is performed by the applicant
standing upon a certain spot near the well, whilst the owner of it
reads a few passages of the sacred Scriptures, and then, taking a small
quantity of water, gives it to the former to drink, and throws the
residue over his head, which is repeated three times, the party
continuing to mutter imprecations <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb396"
href="#pb396" name="pb396">396</a>]</span>in whatever terms his
vengeance may dictate.&rsquo; Rice Rees, in his <i>Essay on the Welsh
Saints</i> (London, 1836), p. 267, speaks of St. Elian as follows:
&lsquo;Miraculous cures were lately supposed to be performed at his
shrine at &#7930;anelian, Anglesey; and near to the church of
&#7930;anelian, Denbighshire, is a well called Ffynnon Elian, which is
thought by the peasantry of the neighbourhood to be endued with
miraculous powers even at present.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Foulkes, s. v. <i>Elian</i>, in his <i>Enwogion Cymru</i>, published
in Liverpool in 1870, expresses the opinion that the visits of the
superstitious to the well had ceased for some time. The last person
supposed to have had charge of the well was a certain John Evans, but
some of the most amusing stories of the shrewdness of the caretaker
refer to a woman who had charge of the well before Evans&rsquo; time. A
series of articles on <i>Ffynnon Eilian</i> appeared in 1861 in a Welsh
periodical called <i>Y Nofely&#273;</i>, printed by Mr. Aubrey at
&#7930;anerch y Me&#273;, in Anglesey. The articles in question were
afterwards published, I am told, as a shilling book, which I have not
seen, and they dealt with the superstition, with the history of John
Evans, and with his confessions and conversion. I have searched in vain
for any account in Welsh of the ritual followed at the well. When Mrs.
Silvan Evans visited the place, the person in charge of the well was a
woman, and Peter Roberts, in his <i>Cambrian Popular Antiquities</i>,
published in London in 1815, alludes to her or a predecessor of hers in
the following terms, p. 246:&mdash;&lsquo;Near the Well resided some
worthless and infamous wretch, who officiated as priestess.&rsquo; He
furthermore gives one to understand that she kept a book in which she
registered the name of each evil wisher for a trifling sum of money.
When this had been done, a pin was dropped into the well in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb397" href="#pb397" name=
"pb397">397</a>]</span>the name of the victim. This proceeding looks
adequate from the magical point of view, though less complicated than
the ritual indicated by Lewis. This latter writer calls the person who
took charge of the well the owner; and I have always understood that,
whether owner or not, he or she used to receive gifts, not only for
placing in the well the names of men who were to be cursed, but also
from those men for taking their names out again, so as to relieve them
from the malediction. In fact, the trade in curses seems to have been a
very thriving one: its influence was powerful and widespread.</p>
<p>Here there is, I think, very little doubt that the owner or guardian
of the well was, so to say, the representative of an ancient priesthood
of the well. That priesthood dated its origin probably many centuries
before a Christian church was built near the well, and coming down to
later times we have unfortunately no sufficient data to show how the
right to such priesthood was acquired, whether by inheritance or
otherwise; but we know that a woman might have charge of St.
Elian&rsquo;s Well.</p>
<p>Let me cite another instance, which I unexpectedly discovered some
years ago in the course of a ramble in quest of early inscriptions.
Among other places which I visited was &#7930;andeilo &#7930;wydarth,
near Maen Clochog, in the northern part of Pembrokeshire. This is one
of the many churches bearing the name of St. Teilo in South Wales: the
building is in ruins, but the churchyard is still used, and contains
two of the most ancient post-Roman inscriptions in the Principality. If
you ask now for &lsquo;&#7930;andeilo&rsquo; in this district, you will
be understood to be inquiring after the farm house of that name, close
to the old church; and I learnt from the landlady that her family had
been there for many generations, though they have not very long been
the proprietors of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb398" href="#pb398"
name="pb398">398</a>]</span>the land. She also told me of St.
Teilo&rsquo;s Well, a little above the house: she added that it was
considered to have the property of curing the whooping-cough. I asked
if there was any rite or ceremony necessary to be performed in order to
derive benefit from the water. Certainly, I was told: the water must be
lifted out of the well and given to the patient to drink by some member
of the family. To be more accurate, I ought to say that this must be
done by somebody born in the house. Her eldest son, however, had told
me previously, when I was busy with the inscriptions, that the water
must be given to the patient by the heir, not by anybody else. Then
came my question how the water was lifted, or out of what the patient
had to drink, to which I was answered that it was out of the skull.
&lsquo;What skull?&rsquo; said I. &lsquo;St. Teilo&rsquo;s
skull,&rsquo; was the answer. &lsquo;Where do you get the saint&rsquo;s
skull?&rsquo; I asked. &lsquo;Here it is,&rsquo; was the answer, and I
was given it to handle and examine. I know next to nothing about
skulls; but it struck me that it was the upper portion of a thick,
strong skull, and it called to my mind the story of the three churches
which contended for the saint&rsquo;s corpse. That story will be found
in the <i>Book of &#7930;an D&acirc;v</i>, pp. 116&ndash;7, and
according to it the contest became so keen that it had to be settled by
prayer and fasting. So, in the morning, lo and behold! there were three
corpses of St. Teilo&mdash;not simply one&mdash;and so like were they
in features and stature that nobody could tell which were the corpses
made to order and which the old one. I should have guessed that the
skull which I saw belonged to the former description, as not having
been much thinned by the owner&rsquo;s use of it; but this I am
forbidden to do by the fact that, according to the legend, this
particular &#7930;andeilo was not one of the three contending churches
which bore away in triumph <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb399" href=
"#pb399" name="pb399">399</a>]</span>a dead Teilo each. The reader,
perhaps, would like to take another view, namely, that the story has
been edited in such a way as to reduce a larger number of Teilos to
three, in order to gratify the Welsh weakness for triads.</p>
<p>Since my visit to the neighbourhood I have been favoured with an
account of the well as it is now current there. My informant is Mr.
Benjamin Gibby of &#7930;angolman Mill, who writes mentioning, among
other things, that the people around call the well <i>Ffynnon yr
Ychen</i>, or the Oxen&rsquo;s Well, and that the family owning and
occupying the farm house of &#7930;andeilo have been there for
centuries. Their name, which is Melchior (pronounced Melshor), is by no
means a common one in the Principality, so far as I know; but, whatever
may be its history in Wales, the bearers of it are excellent Kymry. Mr.
Gibby informs me that the current story solves the difficulty as to the
saint&rsquo;s skull as follows:&mdash;The saint had a favourite maid
servant from the Pembrokeshire &#7930;andeilo: she was a beautiful
woman, and had the privilege of attending on the saint when he was on
his death-bed. As his end was approaching he gave his maid a strict and
solemn command that in a year&rsquo;s time from the day of his burial
at &#7930;andeilo Fawr, in Carmarthenshire, she was to take his skull
to the other &#7930;andeilo, and to leave it there to be a blessing to
coming generations of men, who, when ailing, would have their health
restored by drinking water out of it. So the belief prevailed that to
drink out of the skull some of the water of Teilo&rsquo;s Well ensured
health, especially against the whooping-cough. The faith of some of
those who used to visit the well was so great in its efficacy, that
they were wont to leave it, he says, with their constitutions
wonderfully improved; and he mentions a story related to him by an old
neighbour, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb400" href="#pb400" name=
"pb400">400</a>]</span>Stifyn Ifan, who has been dead for some years,
to the effect that a carriage, drawn by four horses, came once, more
than half a century ago, to &#7930;andeilo. It was full of invalids
coming from Pen Claw&#273;, in Gower, Glamorganshire, to try the water
of the well. They returned, however, no better than they came; for
though they had drunk of the well, they had neglected to do so out of
the skull. This was afterwards pointed out to them by somebody, and
they resolved to make the long journey to the well again. This time
they did the right thing, we are told, and departed in excellent
health.</p>
<p>Such are the contents of Mr. Gibby&rsquo;s Welsh letter; and I would
now only point out that we have here an instance of a well which was
probably sacred before the time of St. Teilo: in fact, one would
possibly be right in supposing that the sanctity of the well and its
immediate surroundings was one of the causes why the site was chosen by
a Christian missionary. But consider for a moment what has happened:
the well paganism has annexed the saint, and established a belief
ascribing to him the skull used in the well ritual. The landlady and
her family, it is true, neither believe in the efficacy of the well,
nor take gifts from those who visit the well; but they continue, out of
kindness, as they put it, to hand the skull full of water to any one
who perseveres in believing in it. In other words, the faith in the
well continues in a measure intact, while the walls of the church have
long fallen into utter decay. Such is the great persistence of some
primitive beliefs; and in this particular instance we have a succession
which seems to point unmistakably to an ancient priesthood of a sacred
spring.</p>

writing the above remarks the following paragraph, purporting to be
copied from the <i>Liverpool Mercury</i> for November 18, 1896,
appeared in the <i lang="la">Arch&aelig;ologia Cambrensis</i> for 1899,
p. 334:&mdash;&lsquo;Two new fishes have just been put in the
&ldquo;Sacred Well,&rdquo; Ffynnon y Sant, at Tyn y Ffynnon, in the
village of Nant Peris, &#7930;anberis. Invalids in large numbers came,
during the last century and the first half of the present century, to
this well to drink of its &ldquo;miraculous waters&rdquo;; and the oak
box, where the contributions of those who visited the spot were kept,
is still in its place at the side of the well. There have always been
two &ldquo;sacred fishes&rdquo; in this well; and there is a tradition
in the village to the effect that if one of the Tyn y Ffynnon fishes
came out of its hiding-place when an invalid took some of the water for
drinking or for bathing purposes, cure was certain; but if the fishes
remained in their den, the water would do those who took it no good.
Two fishes only are to be put in the well at a time, and they generally
live in its waters for about half a century. If one dies before the
other, it would <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb367n" href="#pb367n"
name="pb367n">367</a>]</span>be of no use to put in a new fish, for the
old fish would not associate with it, and it would die. The experiment
has been tried. The last of the two fishes put in the well about fifty
years ago died last August. It had been blind for some time previous to
its death. When taken out of the water it measured seventeen inches,
and was buried in the garden adjoining the well. It is stated in a
document of the year 1776 that the parish clerk was to receive the
money put in the box of the well by visitors. This money, together with
the amount of 6<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>, was his annual stipend.&rsquo; Tyn
y Ffynnon means &lsquo;the Tenement of the Well,&rsquo; <i>tyn</i>
being a shortened form of <i>ty&#273;yn</i>, &lsquo;a
tenement,&rsquo;as mentioned at p. 33 above; but the mapsters make it
into <i>ty&rsquo;n</i> = <i>ty yn</i>, &lsquo;a house in,&rsquo; so
that the present instance, <i>Ty&rsquo;n y Ffynnon</i>, could only mean
&lsquo;the House in the Well,&rsquo; which, needless to say, it is not.
But one would like to know whether the house and land were once held
rent-free on condition that the tenant took care of the sacred
fish.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd25e14214src">&uarr;</a></p>

Judging from the three best-known instances, <i>y bala</i> meant the
outlet of a lake: I allude to this <i>Bala</i> at the outlet of
&#7930;yn Tegid; <i>Pont y Bala</i>, &lsquo;the Bridge of the
<i>bala</i>,&rsquo; across the water flowing from the Upper into the
Lower Lake at &#7930;anberis; and <i>Bala Deulyn</i>, &lsquo;the
<i>bala</i> of two lakes,&rsquo; at Nant&#7931;e. Two places called
<i>Bryn y Bala</i> are mentioned s. v. <i>Bala</i> in Morris&rsquo;
<i>Celtic Remains</i>, one near Aberystwyth, at a spot which I have
never seen, and the other near the lower end of the Lower Lake of
&#7930;anberis, as to which it has been suggested to me that it is an
error for <i>Bryn y Bela</i>. It is needless to say that <i>bala</i>
has nothing to do with the Anglo-Irish <i>bally</i>, of such names as
<i>Ballymurphy</i> or <i>Ballynahunt</i>: this vocable is in English
<i>bailey</i>, and in South Wales <i>beili</i>, &lsquo;a farm yard or
enclosure,&rsquo; all three probably from the late Latin <i>balium</i>
or <i>ballium</i>, &lsquo;<span lang="la">locus palis munitus et
circumseptus</span>.&rsquo; Our etymologists never stop short with
<i>bally</i>: they go as far as <i>Balaklava</i> and, probably,

Cadrawd here gives the Welsh as &lsquo;2 <i lang="cy">bladur</i>
&hellip; 2 <i>&#273;y&#273; o wair</i>,&rsquo; and observes that the
lacuna consists of an illegible word of three letters. If that word was
either <i>sef</i>, &lsquo;that is,&rsquo; or <i>neu</i>,
&lsquo;or,&rsquo; the sense would be as given above. In North
Cardiganshire we speak of a day&rsquo;s mowing as <i lang="cy">gwaith
gwr</i>, &lsquo;a man&rsquo;s work for a day,&rsquo; and sometimes of a
<i lang="cy">gwaith gwr bach</i>, &lsquo;a man&rsquo;s work for a short

<i>By-Gones</i> for May 24, 1899. The full name of Welshpool in Welsh
is <i>Tra&#7931;wng &#7930;ywelyn</i>, so called after a &#7930;ywelyn
descended from Cune&#273;a, and supposed to have established a
religious house there; for there are other Tra&#7931;wngs, and at first
sight it would seem as if <i>Tra&#7931;wng</i> had something to do with
a lake or piece of water. But there is a Tra&#7931;wng, for instance,
near Brecon, where there is no lake to give it the name; and my
attention has been called to Thos. Richards&rsquo; <i>Welsh-English
Dictionary</i>, where a <i>tra&#7931;wng</i> is said to be &lsquo;such
a soft place on the road (or elsewhere) as travellers may be apt to
sink into, a dirty pool.&rsquo; So the word seems to be partly of the
same derivation as <i>go-&#7931;wng</i>, &lsquo;to let go, to give
way.&rsquo; The form of the word in use now is <i>Tra&#7931;wm</i>, not

not profess to see my way through the difficulties which the probable
etymological connexion between the names Setantii, Setanta, Seithyn,
and Seithennin implies. But parts of the following string of guesses
may be found to hold good:&mdash;<i>Seithyn</i> is probably more
correct than <i>Seithin</i>, as it rhymes with <i>cristin</i> =
<i>Cristyn</i> (in <i>Cristynogaeth</i>: see Silvan Evans&rsquo;
<i>Geiriadur</i>, s. v., and Skene&rsquo;s <i>Four Ancient Books</i>,
ii. 210); and it might be assumed to be from the same stem as
<i>Seizun</i>; but, supposing it to represent an earlier
<i>Seithynt</i>, it would equate phonologically with <i>Setanta</i>,
better <i>Setinte</i>, of which the genitive <i>Setinti</i> actually
occurs, as a river name, in the <i>Book of the Dun Cow</i>, fo.
125<sup>b</sup>: see my <i>Hibbert Lectures</i>, p. 455, and see also
the <i>Revue Celtique</i>, xi. 457. It would mean some such an early
form <i>Setn&#805;ti&#815;o-s</i>, and <i>Seithenhin</i>, another
derivative from the same stem, <i>Setn&#805;t&#299;no-s</i>. But the
retention of <i>n</i> before <i>t</i> in <i>Setinte</i> proves it not
to be unconnected with <i>Seithyn</i>, but borrowed from some Brythonic
dialect when the latter was pronounced <i>Seithn&#805;ti&#815;o-s</i>.
If this be anywhere nearly right one has to assume that the manuscripts
of Ptolemy giving the genitive plural as <span class="trans" title=

"grc">&Sigma;&epsilon;&gamma;&tau;&alpha;&nu;&tau;&#8055;&omega;&nu;</span></span>
with <i>cht</i> represented by <i>gt</i> as in Ogams in Pembrokeshire:
witness <i>Ogtene</i> and <i>Maqui Quegte</i>. This conjecture as to
the original reading would suggest that the name was derived from the
seventh numeral <i>sechtn&#805;</i>, just as that of the Galloway
people of the <i>Novant&aelig;</i> seems to be from the ninth numeral.
Ptolemy&rsquo;s next entry to the Harbour of the Setantii is the
estuary of the Belisama, supposed to be the Mersey; and next comes the
estuary of the <span class="trans" title="Seteia"><span class="Greek"
lang="grc">&Sigma;&epsilon;&tau;&epsilon;&#8055;&alpha;</span></span>
or <span class="trans" title="Segeia"><span class="Greek" lang=
"grc">&Sigma;&epsilon;&gamma;&epsilon;&#8055;&alpha;</span></span>,
supposed to be the Dee. Now the country of the Setantii, when they had
a country, may have reached from their harbour near the mouth of the
Ribble to the Seteia or the Dee without the name Seteia or Segeia
having anything to do with their own, except that it may have
influenced the latter in the manuscripts of Ptolemy&rsquo;s text. Then
we possibly have a representative of <i>Seteia</i> or <i>Segeia</i> in
the <i>Saidi</i> or <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb388n" href=
"#pb388n" name="pb388n">388</a>]</span><i>Seidi</i>, sometimes appended
to Seithyn&rsquo;s name. In that case <i>Seithyn Saidi</i>, in the late
Triad iii. 37, would mean Seithyn of Seteia, or the Dee. A <i>Mab
Saidi</i> occurs in the Kulhwch story (<i>Mabinogion</i>, p. 106), also
Cas, son of Saidi (ib. 110); and in <i>Rhonabwy&rsquo;s Dream</i>
Kadyrieith, son of Saidi (ib. 160); but the latter vocable is
<i>Seidi</i> in Triad ii. 26 (ib. 303). It is to be borne in mind that
Ptolemy does not represent the Setantii as a people in his time: he
only mentions a harbour called after the Setantii. So it looks as if
they then belonged to the past&mdash;that in fact they were, as I
should put it, a Goidelic people who had been conquered and partly
expelled by Brythonic tribes, to wit, by the Brigantes, and also by the
Cornavii in case the Setantii had once extended southwards to the Dee.
This naturally leads one to think that some of them escaped to places
on the coast, such as Dyfed, and that some made for the opposite coast
of Ireland, and that, by the time when the C&uacute;chulainn stories
came to be edited as we have them, the people in question were known to
the redactors of those stories only by the Brythonic form of their
name, which underlies that of <i>Setanta Beg</i>, or the Little
Setantian. Those of them who found a home on the coast of Cardigan Bay
may have brought with them a version of the inundation story with
Seithennin, son of Seithyn, as the principal figure in it. So in due
time he had to be attached to some royal family, and in the <i>Iolo
MSS.</i>, pp. 141&ndash;2, he is made to descend from a certain Plaws
Hen, king of Dyfed, while the saints named as his descendants seem to
have belonged chiefly to Gwyne&#273; and Powys.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow"

the lake away to the Wye or the Severn. I am told that this does not

Professor Meyer has given a number of extracts concerning her in his
notes to his edition of <i>The Vision of Mac Conglinne</i> (London,
1892), pp. 131&ndash;4, 208&ndash;10, and recently he has published
<i>The Song of the Old Woman of Beare</i> in the <i>Otia Merseiana</i>
(London, 1899), pp. 119&ndash;28, from the Trinity College codex, H. 3,
18, where we are told, among other things, that her name was Digdi, and
that she belonged to Corcaguiny. The name B&eacute;ara, or
B&eacute;rre, would seem to suggest identification with that of Bera,
daughter of Eibhear, king of Spain, and wife of Eoghan Taidhleach, in
the late story of <i>The Courtship of Mom&eacute;ra</i>, edited by
O&rsquo;Curry in his <i>Battle of Magh Leana</i> (Dublin, 1855); but
the other name Digdi would seem to stand in the way. However none of
the literature in point has yet been discovered in any really old
manuscript, and it may be that the place-name <i>Berre</i>, in
<i>Caillech B&eacute;rri</i>, has usurped the place of the personal
name <i>B&eacute;ra</i>, whose antiquity in some such a form as
<i>B&eacute;ra</i> or <i>M&eacute;ra</i> is proved by its honorific
form <i>Mo-mera</i>: see O&rsquo;Curry&rsquo;s volume, p. 166, and his
Introduction, p. xx.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
